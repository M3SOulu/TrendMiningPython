WSL lets me build out many virtualized Linux systems within itself and it behaves much like my UNIX input on a mac but on Windows. I have visual studio code executing from within Windows into the WSL environment.  I can also back up and restore this WSL environment if I bork it bad.

If I was writing something graphical I can still see Mac having that ground, but I feel development has become more and more agnostic. The quality in Mac has dropped significantly when it used to be the office king. It didn't really drop, the standards and expectations only became greater.

What is everyone's 2022 take on Mac vs Windows, not considering Linux because of too many flavors?",0,1,2022-08-27 00:12:41,windows vs mac   my observation,been developing on mac for a long time  i have to say i m getting more impressed with windows than mac  wsl has come a long way from its original inception and mac s linux subsystem is still very weak  mac was really good   years ago wsl lets me build out many virtualized linux systems within itself and it behaves much like my unix input on a mac but on windows  i have visual studio code executing from within windows into the wsl environment   i can also back up and restore this wsl environment if i bork it bad if i was writing something graphical i can still see mac having that ground  but i feel development has become more and more agnostic  the quality in mac has dropped significantly when it used to be the office king  it didn t really drop  the standards and expectations only became greater what is everyone s  take on mac vs windows  not considering linux because of too many flavors

4,rockitman12,wwy0xz,How does code go from a Jr. Engineer's computer to live on a business website?,"I've only written software as a self-employed engineer. What this means is I lack a lot of knowledge about industry standards and how larger, multi-person teams work. I've always stored my work (completed or otherwise) on GitHub, but then still just push the local files from my computer to the live (prod) server.

One thing I've always been a little in the grey about is how code goes from a Jr Engineer's computer to prod?

I understand that the Jr would submit a ~~push~~ pull request, and then the code would be reviewed, but then what? Can you push code straight from GitHub onto the prod server? Or does the Sr/Lead handle that from their system through a terminal?

I've come to understand that there is commonly a ""main"" server, which is kind of like the staging area right before pushing to prod server?

How are side-projects and new features handled? They're just on a separate branch until merged later?

5,engineerFWSWHW,wwp5z9,Unnecessary unit-test mocking?,"A few months ago, I worked on an existing project. I always like when a project have unit tests because it helps me understand how the functions are being used and I can use it as a playground to experiment with the functions. However, when I dived into the project, many things are mocked unnecessarily.  For example, there is a function to compute a checksum that can be executed on the unit tests, and yet it was mocked.

    uint8_t compute_8bit_checksum(uint8_t *data, uint16_t length);
    // On the unit tests, this is mocked with the expected input and expected return.

I also saw a wrapper for memset to clear an array

    void clearArray(uint8_t * arr, uint16_t length);
    // this is mocked as well

On my previous projects, I use mocks only if necessary and mostly on things that are external and out of my control (especially those that relies on external devices, external database, clock/timers, functions that relies on random number generators,  computation intensive functions). But I don't mock those that can be run on unit tests with deterministic return values (like those above). I believe the two things shown above could be unit tested directly and no need to mock them. And the unit test is challenging to read because of lots of mocking.

The previous dev resigned so I don't know the reasons for this. I am not sure if i am missing anything or what are the rationale of mocking something that can be executed on the unit tests with a deterministic return value? I was under the impression that the previous dev learned mocking and he/she became too enthusiastic about mocking and possibly became too adventurous and led to its uncontrolled usage.

I am a junior web dev, mostly FE (albeit with 10 years of experience in a different field, so I'm not straight out of uni) working in a relatively small company. We're working on a new FE and I find myself struggling with breaking down tasks into smaller pieces. My Jira ticket is basically a link to our Figma page view without any steps/analysis done whatsoever. The views handed to me are quite straight-forward (eg registering forms, list views, data tables) and I can always check the existing version of our product (written in a different JS library) to find the correct API endpoints and so on. However, sometimes I find myself working on small (and maybe unimportant) details for way too long. I've been working as a dev for 5 months, I have no idea how long a task should take, and sometimes I find myself jumping back and forth between different things. I also happen to have ADHD, which makes organization and focusing difficult and many things that come naturally to my colleagues are a struggle for me.

It seems that they are not experienced in onboarding junior developers (I don't think they've had many juniors before, our devs started the company and have been doing the work since the beginning themselves so far, we don't have a project manager either). I am not sure how to ask for help in this matter either, as it is not a technical thing, rather than work organization thing.

29,devsidev,wkj1ak,One Event Many Listeners vs Many Events,"Hi devs!

In a micro-service infrastructure I'm using RabbitMQ to broadcast messages (translating to events) across the internal network to perform functions. I have a question of possibly conflicting opinion.

Here's an example:  


I have 2 services for the purpose of this question, Service A, and Core Service.  


**Scenario:**

*Service A* completes its task, and needs to ""send an email"", ""update some user statistics"", and ""Award some points to the user"". Those 3 tasks do not belong on Service A, they are things that can be done from a multitude of services. Therefore the code to do these 3 things is on *Core Service*.

**Option 1:**

*Service A* broadcasts 3 Events (one for each action) and sends all 3 in to RabbitMQ. *Core Service* converts the 3 messages from RabbitMQ back in to 3 Events and 3 Listeners pick them up to perform the 3 actions.

**Option 2:**

*Service A* broadcasts ONE event (lets call it ""ServiceATaskCompleted""), and sends it on to RabbitMQ. *Core Service* converts the 1 message (event) from RabbitMQ, and the 3 Listeners pick up ""ServiceATaskCompleted"", and each listener performs its own action like in Option 1.

&#x200B;

**Questions:**

This really could be a developer preference, but i'm keen to know if maybe there's a ""correct"" answer here, how would you do it?

Is there any downside to having 3 events instead of 1? Is it a code smell to have an Event be ""SendEmail"" instead of something more like ""onServiceComplete""?

I would like to introduce to you the world’s first open source blog, [Swarm](https://ridhwandev.github.io/Swarm/). By open source blog we are actually targeting the content of the site to be open source rather than the code. 

We read articles on medium, LinkedIn, hashnode etc but the problem is that these are static resources written by usually 1 person.  Swarm aims to reach out to professionals around the world to create guidelines and useful information together using the power of open source. We already have the capabilities of raising PRs and approving that we can use to manage collaboration. The bets part is that in 5 years time when best practices have changed the resources will still be up to date.

This is currently an experiment and if we succeed in creating useful resources from a collective of people then we will be building the site up from scratch to host a range of features to make this process completely autonomous. We’re currently focused on the tech space but this has potential to grow so I urge you to [check it out](https://ridhwandev.github.io/Swarm/), where you can find more info on it as well as links to our discord server and information about development and contribution!

My understanding of TDD is that the output or state given by a set of code is determined by some predefined pass/fail condition. Obvious enough.

In terms of Declarative vs. Imperative code:

Do the test conditions necessarily have to be declarative?

Do I have to write a unit test for each function, or can I just write a test that implies the use of that function?

I'm doing this challenge for practice from a company I applied to work for many years ago: [github.com/pillar/checkout-order-total](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-checkout-order-total/blob/master/README.md)

e.g. Since the point of the task is to calculate the final sum of all scanned items, could I just write one test to validate the final state after each function is run?

Should I still write unit tests for each type of scan?

Is it OK to write Imperative and Declarative tests at the same time, or is Declarative always better?

Also, could you give me any other advice on the best way to approach test writing for this challenge",7,3,2022-07-11 00:34:44,imperative vs  declarative approach in tdd,so for a while now i ve been trying to make use of testing in a way to boost the quality and productivity in my code writing  so far i just end up spending more time on test writing for not very much benefit  i think its because i still don t really understand what tdd is supposed to be about i m not talking about the tests themselves  i mean conceptually  what is it that i m really testing and how do i use it in a way that is actually useful  i m asking because the way i do testing now seems like a burden my understanding of tdd is that the output or state given by a set of code is determined by some predefined pass fail condition  obvious enough in terms of declarative vs  imperative code do the test conditions necessarily have to be declarative do i have to write a unit test for each function  or can i just write a test that implies the use of that function i m doing this challenge for practice from a company i applied to work for many years ago   github com pillar checkout order total  https e g  since the point of the task is to calculate the final sum of all scanned items  could i just write one test to validate the final state after each function is run should i still write unit tests for each type of scan is it ok to write imperative and declarative tests at the same time  or is declarative always better also  could you give me any other advice on the best way to approach test writing for this challenge

* How did you track work at the start of the project?

I am expected to pickup an existing project and make a few changes, develop it further etc. 

Project was developed single handedly by a guy who left the company and no one else has any experience of Typescript/React which covers 80% of codebase. It uses it's own API and Postgres. There is only 1 other developer at the company who does most stuff in Pascal/Visual basic. 

The project I need to work on is not extremely complex, but it's still quite a lot as I'm only learning things.

85,devsidev,vmv91m,Service based API and code duplication,"Hey all,

If I have a few APIs that work together to create a product, but there's common code between them, whats the easiest way to go about sharing common code? 

For example, I have 3 APIs that deliver specific services for 1 product. Using AWS API Gateway I can route the incoming requests to the specific API. However all 3 APIs need to send emails. The configuration for that is fairly custom. I could copy the code in to all 3 projects and create duplication, but I feel like this could be a problem when someone makes a change to the way email works and only updates 1/3 projects.

I'm a bit reluctant to spin up yet another service just to send emails as the same thing would apply for any other shared code that makes its way in to the projects, and that starts to get expensive. 

From what I can see I have 2 choices:

1. Code duplication (and deal with it)
2. Create a lib, have it in its own package, managed separately and bring it in using a package manager. (creates yet another project to manage, but at least its not an entire service of its own)

105,Xtianus21,vd8lme,The number 1 thing that is wrong with agile development [FMVP],"I am writing this post to express my frustration with what people refer to as agile development. To me agile is where the business goes through the process of masquerading waterfall development and fudging it in a way they refer to it as agile development. 

They really do a good job of masking it too. They plan and conduct 2 week sprints. They have scrum meetings. They have stories that are created and put it into the backlog. They even have backlog refinement. They point stories in a poker game. And the best one yet, they have retrospectives so everyone can tell you how crappy the process was for that 2 week sprint. 

Who am I? I am a Senior Director of Engineering for a very large company. This is my ~~story~~ nightmare. 

So looking at why one of our deliveries was going so ""bumpy"" it dawned on me. WE ARE NOT DOING AGILE. STOP SAYING. You hear phrases the QA team, and this is what threw me over the edge, ""This isn't waterfall."" 

Wait, what? What did you just say? This isn't waterfall. You're saying that because of what we're telling you. We're telling you that we are not going to deliver you a broken application in pieces until it is ready. 

Ah ha. You don't know, nor does anyone realize you are in fact doing waterfall. 

So where does waterfall come from and is it even a bad thing. My answer is no. But what is bad is not realizing you're doing it and trying to everything else in agile and act as if it is all agile. 

The problem starts with this 1 single acronym. MVP. Or FMVP. FULL(AF) MVP.  

I dawned on me that the MVP word is the issue here. If you give me requirements that are 30 features big. That's inherently NOT agile. You're asking for an entire product to be delivered to you. You're not pieces you're doing the whole entire thing. And this is the issue. You have to work and understand what is an actual deliverable thing. 

Testing in an agile way would accommodate that just fine. What doesn't work is saying you're agile, doing waterfall and then trying to test in agile. NO, you have to wait until it's ALL working. You have to wait until we integrate the api's and we add in all the features that you want. Because that's what you requested. 

Agile, if you were doing it would take the features desired but then plan deliverables of a usable part of the application. 

If the app pulls data and that is what makes the app work, YOU NEED THE DATA WORKING. You can't come in, LOL, and say we're building the data along side our development. What even is that? You can't say you want to deliver this behemoth of an application and target a delivery in the future without at least planning that key items, ahem, data are coinciding with the delivery of the parts of the application. Which did I tell you is around 30 different features. 

You my friend, didn't plan out a proper MVP. You planned out an entire application. That's waterfall, NOT agile. 

The word flexible is not synonymous with the word agile. The ability to plan out the delivery of an application and remain flexible while doing it and deliver parts of a working application in pieces...  That's agile. 

I have thought of a way to communicate this and I think we as developers need to add a word, or letter, onto the phrase MVP. B, as in BARE. The BARE MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT. As to emphasize that if you go down the path of planning a million features (ok, more than 10) to deliver by a date you will in fact be planning waterfall. 

And waterfall is ok, but sticking the agile process in front of it and calling agile - NOT OK. Because what are you going to do?... You're going to go to your delivery date, that you most likely picked out of a hat, and say ""why can't we make the date?"" or ""Why can't QA test it."" or ""Why can't we give this to QA."" or ""Why isn't it ready yet."" :-( 

Because it's not working that's why.

Or better yet, you want to test the api's and give us back those api's you tested per the specs', which wasn't written by the way; that's fine. You want to test the front-end and build your automation scripts on our dummy data; that's fine. But that's not end-to-end testing and that is not delivering to you what we ultimately need to. And that's what our internal QA testing team is doing. 

What I'm not going to do is hand you a boat full of features that aren't working yet and give that to QA to run through the application knowing it's not working. Btw, all-the-mean-while blowing past your cat in the hat delivery dates. 

I'm not doing that to my development team and I'm not doing that to my internal QA testing team. 

Realize what a BMVP is and plan for that. In that way, we can deliver parts and pieces and build the application up from there. In the end, it can be delivered and tested and then ultimately released to the business. And then we can work on other features needed and add those in from there. Agile.

Please, I implore you all, stop calling waterfall...

108,bzq84,vc1bxw,Why such obsession and trust in measuring everything?,"I'd like to ask in order to challenge, understand and find arguements in my further discussions about huge (and in my opinion blind) pursuit towards measuring everything (yet wrong things in a broken way).

The context is that managers wants to have clear metrics in order to evaluate teams **and individuals**, and I totally understand the need and sensibility of this when doing for teams and departments.

The issue starts when metric obsessions are adopted for **individuals**. (Note that it was proven long time ago that measuring lines of codes or bugs per line is very bad, thus I'll skip this from this post).

In most common scenarios, **individuals** works in the context of a team (rarely alone). When a team is being given a task (e.g. improve package dispatching or reduce help support calls) it's impossible to determine how much each individual contributed to that initiative/metric.

On the other hand, if an individual is being given a goal ""improve best practices in the team"" or ""help junior developers grow"" this things are **highly opinionated** (the result of that is an opinion of who evaluates that initiative, thus highly subjective).

I had 2hrs discussion with my manager, when he/she asked me to propose my very own Goals and Metrics. When I said I can find goals, but can't find metrics (because of reasons stated above) and I asked him to propose some **objective metrics** he/she was struggling to do so, proposed only subjective, opinion-based ones, and of course, didn't admit the I was right, and that it's hard to find so.

I have dabbled in a bit of programming over the last 5 years or so, focussing mostly on iOS using swift, but also some Python, PHP, JS, etc. I am getting very close to releasing my first (simple) iOS app for user testing - yay.

My day job is financial modelling - making bespoke cost models for engineering projects mostly, so there's some overlap there too.

My question that I come to you gurus with is, is there a single agreed on process for software development? A kind of life cycle? Or if not a single process, what processes are there? and how do you choose one?

I am thinking along the lines of, Requirements capture -> prototype -> test -> release -> Maintain.

But this feels too broad to be useful as process. For example, how do I go form requirements capture to then outlining what my classes will be, and modules, and how they link, and what the UI will be like... etc etc.

Don’t get me wrong, like many self-proclaimed internet “developers” I can install Wordpress Plugins and I can duct-tape and superglue HTML, CSS, PHP off-the-shelf solutions to do my bidding most of the time (with enough Googling)… but as we can all agree, my kung-fu is weak.

Anyways, I have an idea that I spent a couple years on that requires truly custom development.  I already have lots of cocktail napkin functionality wire-framed on Axure.  Several years ago I even outsourced to a small firm.  However, since I had other businesses to manage (and am not really a developer who can properly gauge their progress) the entire project fell apart.

What do you guys think would be the best path for my first hire?  Should I be starting from top-down with a CTO or should I concentrate on hiring a single software developer and expand from there?  Or should I be looking for some type of technical “advisor”?

Are people coming right out of school too green to be early hires (I live close to a very prestigious CS school)? 

This is for a web app in the EdTech space that utilizes crowdsourcing and machine learning.  I do have experience in the EdTech industry (and have successfully exited my other companies).  I can easily do a couple years runway with a few employees.  But, I obviously don’t want to flush money down the toilet for staff that is unwarranted.

TLDR: What order should I hire people & what would best attract them ($$, stock options, “excitement” of a new startup, etc.). 

Thanks!!

118,No-Ear6313,v6rpre,How to name services that are interchangeable,"Hi, we have two service names that we're going to alternate when we deploy a new version.

let's say Foo is now used to run production requests and Bar is to be used re-provision with a new version of the code (blue - green deployment).

After Bar is completely deployed/tested/scaled we'll route traffic to Bar and Foo will be used for re-provisioning.

&#x200B;

So you can see why we can't name them blue-green (because blue should mean it's the one in production always), nor can we let them named as Foo-Bar since that gives the impression these services are dummies.

151,Zihas990,uwptx8,The Basics of Open Source,"I've been interviewing Open Source leaders and Maintainers over the last 6 months, both to help Maintainers get more help, and also to bring newcomers to Open Source projects to help the project, learn software development techniques (working on a different methodology than you use at work is, IMO, a great way to better understand both methods),  and advance their careers.   


Here is how I would explain Open Source to newcomers-- I would welcome your feedback or questions.

&#x200B;

**1. What is Open Source?**

&#x200B;

\[Note that this is a summarized definition of Open Source, intended for Beginner and Intermediate Audiences. For Advanced and Expert audiences we recommend you review the definitions at the Open Source Initiative.\]

&#x200B;

Open Source code is code that is accessible to everyone, and (almost always) is created and maintained at least in part by members of the public.

&#x200B;

“Accessible to everyone” means a viewer only needs to create a user account on a version control system like GitHub, Once they do that, they can see Open Source projects.

&#x200B;

“Created and maintained at least in part by members of the public” means that not only can viewers view the code, but they can also make suggested changes such as features or bug fixes, and can review others’ code.

&#x200B;

The Maintainers of the Open Source project– the leadership of one or more repositories– set out guidelines for Contributors of the code on how to write, propose and review code. There are almost always fewer Maintainers than Contributors.

&#x200B;

The opposite of Open Source code is private code. To access private code, not only do you need a version control system account, but you also need an invitation to that private repository (code is stored in repositories, one or more repositories make up an application).

&#x200B;

**2. Say more about what Open Source Maintainers do.**

  
Open Source Maintainers are responsible for organizing Open Source projects.

&#x200B;

This includes organizing the work of Contributors, including the processes for recommending improvements, adding proposed code, and approving that code. Maintainers can approve code (in GitHub, via reviewing pull requests), and Contributors can too, depending on the project’s guidelines.

&#x200B;

But Maintainers do a lot more than that, too. To quote one of the Maintainers I interviewed:

&#x200B;

“Being a Maintainer is not just about coding, it’s about finding issues that are really good, especially for first-time contributors to the repository. I try to sit down and go through the code and see if I can find good first issues on a fairly regular basis, so that I can help new people to get involved with our code.”

&#x200B;

**3. What are examples of Open Source?**

  
A neat example of Open Source code comes from NASA- at github dot com slash nasa \[I hope this is ok-- I'm not affiliated, just a fan\]

&#x200B;

NASA has published 413 Open Source projects, some of which are combined to create applications.

&#x200B;

One of the applications is Cumulus, which is used to collect information about the Earth’s atmosphere.

&#x200B;

You can that Cumulus is actively under development — there are changes made within minutes of this screenshot.

&#x200B;

From here you can dig in and see that one repository within Cumulus, also named Cumulus, has 2810 finalized or rejected changes (closed Pull Requests) and 10 changes that haven’t been accepted yet (open Pull Requests).

&#x200B;

**4. How big is Open Source?**

  
It’s huge, and it’s growing every day.

&#x200B;

One estimate is that there are 180,000 Open Source projects.

&#x200B;

And Open Source code is incorporated into many other projects. One recent estimate found that 96% of all applications included some Open Source code.

&#x200B;

GitHub estimates that 19% of code contributions went to Open Source projects:

&#x200B;

Open Source contributors and maintainers can come from all walks of life and are around the globe. 80% of Open Source contributors in 2019 came from outside the US.

&#x200B;

**5. Can anyone use Open Source code once it’s created?**

  
Sort of.

&#x200B;

It is technically possible to take any Open Source project and make a copy of it– that’s part of what it means to be Open Source.

&#x200B;

However, there are also important legal– and in my view, ethical– considerations.

&#x200B;

First, the legal ones.

&#x200B;

All Open Source code comes with a license, which lays out how you are allowed to that code. Private code has licenses too.

&#x200B;

These licenses vary substantially.

&#x200B;

Some licenses are quite permissive– you can do whatever you want with the code.

&#x200B;

Some licenses have very particular requirements: if you use the code and share it, you are required to give away any code you create for free as well. This is called a “CopyLeft” license. Violations of CopyLeft can be a big deal for companies– such as lawsuits.

&#x200B;

What does that mean for you?

&#x200B;

First, know that there is no way to tell what kind of license it is just based on having access to it– you have to read the license.

&#x200B;

Good news, if you are exploring the code to learn from it, there’s nothing to worry about.

&#x200B;

If you are using the code personally– not just exploring it, but putting the code to work– then you need to read the license file. If it’s a commercial license, do the right thing and pay for it.

&#x200B;

Those are the legal issues. Let’s talk about the ethical issues.

&#x200B;

Open Source code is only based on the community of millions of coders who make it possible.

&#x200B;

Even if the license type is permissive, I believe all Open Source users, whether individuals or teams, have an obligation to give back to the communities who’ve created the code.

&#x200B;

From my Scouting days there is an expression– leave a campfire better than you found it. This can apply to codebases generally, but it also applies to Open Source: if you use Open Source code, you should help make that Open Source code or other Open Source code better.

&#x200B;

Thankfully there are many ways to give back to Open Source, and not just by coding.

&#x200B;

* As an individual, become a Contributor or a Maintainer to the code
* As an individual, become a Contributor or a Maintainer for the community
* As an organization, donate to Open Source projects that your company uses
* As an organization, donate goods or services (such as your company’s software) to Open Source projects",0,1,2022-05-24 15:36:26,the basics of open source,i ve been interviewing open source leaders

We are building software for a client that requires a variety of third party website providers to be able to create & update records in our client's database. The gold standard has always been some sort of feed implementation which looks like this:

1. Build a system to consume a feed
2. Ensure each feed has a unique reference
3. Create documentation for third party to build a feed to our specification
4. Get them to provide a URL to their feed (json, xml, or something like that)
5. Enter URL into our system and consume the feed to populate database

However, we've been toying with the idea of instead simply building a REST API, along with the appropriate documentation, which allows the third party to consume and ultimately POST & UPDATE records in our database. There are limitations to this however, compared with the feed approach.

I am looking for some opinions, tips, tricks, tutorials or ideas for this kind of implementation. Have you every built something like this in the past? How did you do it?

My question is what is the best approach for this problem, as it needs to have a web frontend and be a desktop app, so electron is the clear choice here for that, but if the backend and frontend will be written in javascript, then communicating and running python and c/c++ does not become trivial.

I've read a good deal conceptually about A/B testing but wanted to ask how it is typically implemented in industry in the context of websites and mobile apps. To go off a simple use-case, suppose I have a React app and wish to test the effectiveness of rendering two buttons with different colors and call-to-action titles.

Are there any go-to services/libraries that specialize in A/B testing to help render the right components on the frontend and send/log results to a backend/portal or would I have to set up the rendering and analytics by myself? — Curious to know what industry practice is for A/B testing both in small-scale and large-scale settings; the more info the merrier.

200,goro-7,ua4gpd,"Using per day calculation approach is leading to huge DB, is this valid system design approach ?","Hi, I have recently joined a Fintech startup which still at growing stage.The platform we manage is basically portfolio management.

We take account transactions from our users banks, exchange rates, asset prices (from 3rd party like Reuters) and calculate portfolio valuation and performance.

So the flow is can be summarized as

    security transactions -> asset units -> prices -> exchange rates ->  portfolio value  

My question is regarding an old and core micro service in this platform which has SOA. It has several performance issue and causes are several but primary bottle neck is DB.

Currently the DB size is 400 GB in production though start up is just 4 years old. When i checked, i feel a measure thing was missed out while designing this service or i might be wrong also.

The approach used in design is that for, at any stage of processing the service calculates per day values and stores them in DB.

What i mean by per day value is better to explain in examples.

The basic calculation flow is

    Transaction - > Asset Units * Price *  Exchange Rate = current value   

Now for asset units , there is a per day table i.e. every day for all users total units of each asset is calculated and inserted into DB irrespective of new transactions came in or not.

Same for exchange rates and prices, every day for each currency a new row is inserted even if it didn't change.

This looks very clean as you take per day values from each table for a date and multiple to get portfolio value on particular date.

But it leads to redundant data and huge DB. As you can observe here space complexity is not only factor of users & transactions but number of days passed so far which is infinite.

So during proper system design anyone would know it leads to redundancy, huge DB and will not scale. But question is, can it be some FinTech weird bureaucratic or compliance requirements to keep Per Day calculation Or is it some system design style which i am not aware of ? Off-course the original developer has left to ask him / her and rest are just making guesses or some arguments which don't still justify this approach.

This  article will be helpful for those developers who are trying to  integrate multiple accounting tools with a custom web or desktop  application; with the accounting tool database exposed either using  ODBC/JDBC or APIs.

The  solution was explored when I worked in a project where there was a need  to automate the data transmission (bi-directional) between different  accounting tools (like Adagio, QB Desktop and Online version, etc.)  interfacing with a central database. And make it possible for devices  (like iPhone) to transmit data to the central database and subsequently  to the accounting tools. In a nutshell, the main application, devices  and multiple accounting tools needed to be in sync all the time/whenever  required.

**The Solution**

The major features that were provided/implemented:

* Connector: it acts as a bridge between web API and desktop/online accounting tool.
* Data transmission between different entities using customized XML
* Logging request and response on each event with a different status
* The parser in the background (it basically parses the data from XML and maps it with the database)
* Common database structure to handle request and response for different tools

I know how to handle the backend (i think you call it that, like the calculations you want to have performed and stuff - like data analysis with the tidyverse and visualizations with ggplot). Front end i have 0 experience however.

I envision a gui that can be opened by executing a .exe file, it opens a window where i can drag and drop input files and some tabs where the results show up, this kind of stuff.

My question: which packages and tools would you most strongly suggest? Im willing to expand my horizon within the 4 languages mentioned, do you have some concrete advice how to best approach this?

I would just write a shiny app with R, but they're too slow and Id like to easily incorporate julia and python code, if thats possible..

227,bzq84,tz339c,Starting new role as senior manager - I want to change the way how team builds software - I need your feedback.,"Intro:

I am a developer with 15y of experience, with some management experience. I'm starting new senior management role soon.

Observation:

Through my career I've seen many ways which tried to make software good in a systematic way (scrum, TDD, code reviews, and more) yet there's always a way to make a spaghetti/big ball of mud.

My conclusion is pretty simple: **no amount of processes, policies, methodologies and 360 feedbacks will ever work, if no major emphasise is put on code quality**. Do you agree or not?

Plan:

As a senior manager, I want to make sure my engineers can (and will) write clean and readable code. Meaning I want to promote those who do this, and let go those who can't write clean, readable, well structured solution.

Example 1: If someone shows me 100% code coverage, but tests are one big messy code - I'll consider it as a disadvantage of that developer (despite coversge metric is met).

Example 2: if team delivered a feature but code is unreadable by others - it's not considered ""done"".

Example 3: if CodeReviews are accepted without any comments, I'll consider it as clumsy and lazy work.

Question:

Do you think that emphasising code quality will be a good startegic move? Or rather as a senior manager I should focus on higher metrics and business value and peoples matters?",64,19,2022-04-08 16:04:08,starting new role as senior manager   i want to change the way how team builds software   i need your feedback ,intro i am a developer with y of experience  with some management experience  i m starting new senior management role soon observation through my career i ve seen many ways which tried to make software good in a systematic way  scrum  tdd  code reviews  and more  yet there s always a way to make a spaghetti big ball of mud my conclusion is pretty simple    no amount of processes  policies  methodologies and  feedbacks will ever work  if no major emphasise is put on code quality    do you agree or not plan as a senior manager  i want to make sure my engineers can  and will  write clean and readable code  meaning i want to promote those who do this  and let go those who can t write clean  readable  well structured solution example   if someone shows me   code coverage  but tests are one big messy code   i ll consider it as a disadvantage of that developer  despite coversge metric is met  example   if team delivered a feature but code is unreadable by others   it s not considered done example   if codereviews are accepted without any comments  i ll consider it as clumsy and lazy work question do you think that emphasising code quality will be a good startegic move  or rather as a senior manager i should focus on higher metrics and business value and peoples matters

Linx is built for companies who need a fast, simple, and secure way to create backend services, integrations, and APIs.  It enables developers and operations to go from ideation to production in hours or days versus weeks or months by giving them one seamless, combined experience that abstracts away the complexity of software development.  


Some of the unique features include;

* All-Purpose - Linx is an abstraction of programming itself and not domain, process or tooling specific. This means it can be used for any backend application in any domain with no limitations on connections to other tools and services. 
* Programming Paradigm - Linx is not constrained by a domain or use-case driven paradigm and is often used in conjunction with other low-code tools to provide the API or integration services that those tools are not designed for. It also allows for the easy implementation of complex functionality. 
* Developer Experience - Typical use is similar to working in any other traditional IDEs. Users can build, debug and test functionality using common operations for functions, types and services. 
* Technology agnostic - Linx works with any tool or service (SaaS, systems, apps and legacy), database (SQL, Oracle, OLE DB, ODBC, Postgres Mongo) and files (XML, Json, text, csv, PDF)
* Hosting - 1-click deployment to on-premise or cloud.

So I was wondering what approach others take to developing apps with heavy crud functionality?

I'm thinking I should build one form and then use that for updates and deletes, but put some logic into my controller which specifies which type of form to generate and the actions to take? Is this this approach others would take? But this still means I will end up generating about 30 or more forms for all the different elements.

Is there another way?

On one side - engineers just want to do the job an go home. The better they do it (e.g. cleaner code, more automation) the more time they suppose to have for themselves. They want to be paid for job done, instead of time spent.

On the other side, there's ""management"" (I lack good name here, thus it is in quotes) point of view, where there are meetings for everything, and almost all decisions has to be done ""collaboratively"". Ultimately this results that engineers spend more time weekly on meetings than doing the job. (E.g. engineers discussing with product owner, manager and designer the ultimate layout of a view/screen and later discussing importance of agile, later discussing company goals, and later discussing TDD and later discussing company business updates etc).

So question is - are this additional meetings really helpful from startegic point of view, culture building? Or should engineers be protected from excessive meetings (max 4 meetings weekly + short standups) and then left to do the job?",9,18,2022-03-30 12:14:59,more meetings vs more time to do the job,so there s this thing that bothers me since quite few years on one side   engineers just want to do the job an go home  the better they do it  e g  cleaner code  more automation  the more time they suppose to have for themselves  they want to be paid for job done  instead of time spent on the other side  there s management  i lack good name here  thus it is in quotes  point of view  where there are meetings for everything  and almost all decisions has to be done collaboratively  ultimately this results that engineers spend more time weekly on meetings than doing the job   e g  engineers discussing with product owner  manager and designer the ultimate layout of a view screen and later discussing importance of agile  later discussing company goals  and later discussing tdd and later discussing company business updates etc  so question is   are this additional meetings really helpful from startegic point of view  culture building  or should engineers be protected from excessive meetings  max  meetings weekly   short standups  and then left to do the job

Basically, we would lose money if the client call me everyday about issues that turn out to be just user error, and my team have to spend time explaining it to them, which wouldn't be covered under warranty since it's not our fault.

Quick bg: the project I'm working on consists of >10 microservices. While we have some automated testing, every feature is manually tested by QAs on branch(es) by deploying the entire stack on one of VMs from our pool. Only then the feature branch(es) is merged into a develop)

Now, these stage environments are built on Jenkins using parameterized job - we basically select branch of each microservice and hit run, and then an Ansible playbook kills existing vm on a pool, creates a new one and installs the whole project.

When I started investigating Gitlab's pipeline features, I found out that a similar parameterized job does not exist, and basically the only remotely similar feature is to manually overwrite default parameters in a pipeline, and there you have to both write name and full value of the parameter by hand, no handy branch dropdowns.

Gitlab seems to be both mature environment and serious about replacing pretty much all the Devops stack. The decision to remove manual input from pipelines seems intentional.

I'm a product manager but really I'm also a dev lead or at least the main stakeholder for their team. We have a scrum master who's not as involved as he probably should be, but we're starting to have some issues as we grow. Our dev team is outsourced and consists of 8 people in India, QA, Back end guys, etc.

I'm staying up morning and night making sure that they understand the requirements and what is expected of them, but recently we've had to do more handholding than usual. Our network guys have to walk them through how to open a port, or check resourcing. I have to tell them how to talk to each other and get past seemingly very basic roadblocks. It's like I have a class of kindergartners and have to tell them how to think.

They can code fine when given very specific parameters, but as we grow I can't hand-hold everyone. Do I need to enforce the Scrum-master is far more involved, do I need a clear expectations list or just tell them to figure it out. I can't teach how to google, or critically think though - it's a big issue and everyone on our end is getting annoyed and it's almost like we're enabling them when we do stuff for them.

Am I the problem in not setting expectations, or do we just have a shitty dev team?

One other caveat is that the hierarchies can be re-structured at will, i.e. you can move an asset somewhere else, or assign a user to a different place in the hierarchy.

However, I would like to work on some best practices about what approaches are most effective to catch the eye of a STRONG and PASSIONATE SOFTWARE DEVELOPER (of any level).

It would be super amazing if you could help me out here and give me some input on the following! (No hatred please, thanks very much!)

&#x200B;

1. What, in your opinion, makes a good / fabulous Recruiter?
2. What, in your opinion, makes a not so good Recruiter?
3. If a Recruiter reaches out to you with an opportunity, what details do you WANT to hear?
4. If a Recruiter reaches out to you with an opportunity, what details do you NOT WANT to hear?
5. Describe a work environment / culture- that you prefer. 
6. Define Work-Life-Balance :-)

If you don't want to take too much time to answer all of those questions, don't worry! Everything on that end will be helpful to improve our recruiting process - this is not an official Amazon campaign - only a Recruiter that wants to do some innovative field work and research.

307,LostMekkaSoft,smu7wp,How beneficial is it to assign code names to big release versions?,"There are many software projects that use code names for big releases, like for example Node Argon (4.x) through Iron (20.x). 

I have seen this a lot throughout the years, but I am not fully convinced that this is a good practice and I am very curious what people from the wider software development community think of it.

For me personally, it is kind of a double edged sword. Sometimes it is nice for communication with end users, as in ""Do you have Android Oreo, or Pie?"", since there is a better chance for them to remember the code names instead of the version numbers. On the other hand, I find it a bit unpleasant to work with at times. For example, I don't come into contact with Node much, but when I do, it is usually a build pipeline setup, where I need to pick the right Node Docker image for the pipeline. Requirements often come in version numbers, but Docker images come with code name tags. So I often need to look up the code names again, which is mildly annoying.

&#x200B;

311,Bluxmit,sjp9cn,How I develop from multiple computers,"It is not a typical need - to be able to develop the same code from multiple computers. In most cases it is easy - we have version control for this. Git pus on one mache, and pull on another. All good. Enough for web and backend development.

But there is a small number of cases, when the projects are a bit too complex for this, and involve installation of system packages, config files, ssh keys, datasets, setting env variables for different branches. It is still possible to sync both machines, but now you will probably spend an evening. 

This happened to me with machine learning / data science projects. Such projects typically require lots of experimentations to train the most optimal ML model. And all of these experiments need to be reproducible. So all of the configs, settings, for each experiment should be saved in a different branch. 

I found a solution of having it all in docker images, that can be committed pushed to a private registry and pulled back on another machine. Having it in docker allowed to isolate environments, try something new in a separate environment without drinking to create mess. And then I was able to move enttire environment from laptop to moverful PC. How to move, I described in this article [https://medium.com/@bluxmit/how-to-develop-from-multiple-computers-cef2d9172e14](https://medium.com/@bluxmit/how-to-develop-from-multiple-computers-cef2d9172e14)",14,10,2022-02-03 19:41:51,how i develop from multiple computers,it is not a typical need   to be able to develop the same code from multiple computers  in most cases it is easy   we have version control for this  git pus on one mache  and pull on another  all good  enough for web and backend development but there is a small number of cases  when the projects are a bit too complex for this  and involve installation of system packages  config files  ssh keys  datasets  setting env variables for different branches  it is still possible to sync both machines  but now you will probably spend an evening  this happened to me with machine learning   data science projects  such projects typically require lots of experimentations to train the most optimal ml model  and all of these experiments need to be reproducible  so all of the configs  settings  for each experiment should be saved in a different branch  i found a solution of having it all in docker images  that can be committed pushed to a private registry and pulled back on another machine  having it in docker allowed to isolate environments  try something new in a separate environment without drinking to create mess  and then i was able to move enttire environment from laptop to moverful pc  how to move  i described in this article  https   medium com  bluxmit how to develop from multiple computers cefde  https   medium com  bluxmit how to develop from multiple computers cefde

I don't think everyone fully understands the disadvantages of not knowing version control/git. When proper protocol isn't followed your team will waste time and resources fixing something that could have been solved if everyone on your team took one day to learn git and put your cheat sheet in place. A few examples that have caused me a few headaches in the past and will surely do the same to you and your team:

1. This involves proper communication as well. For instance, someone in the team will create a new branch off of the wrong branch. This causes huge problems when a merge is finally initiated, => think person A has implemented a feature in the same script you are editing (but without his edits). Once the merge finally happens person A's code will be deleted when you merge, or features that you have fixed will disappear.

2. Pulling changes onto a branch when a commit hasn't happened. This basically makes 2 splits in your code so when you finally push up you will often have duplicate code and random headers which is a whole can of worms on its own. You will see this >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Coworker A.

321,marschelpoet,sebdps,How far should you plan ahead when working agile/Scrum?,"So, I am working in larger project for around 2 years now, and we have not recently hit a point, where our planning is actually on the same level as the current development progress.

Basically, each week, we do Backlog Refinements, where we go through our User Stories, try to understand and refine them etc. The problem is, that we are always talking about Stories, which are either going to be implemented in the next sprint already or which even are in the current sprint. This refinement is usually happening on a really high detail, because our PO does not really have an understanding of the requirements himself (yet he is only one knowing them at all), and we as developers need to try to understand his limited understanding.

This more than often leads to really vague stories, which will then be discussed in further technical detail in different calls, when we actually start working on them. Often we also realize in these sessions first, that the requirements are either completely irrational or out of scope, which in turn blows our sprints.

(We actually had to scrap 2 Stories today, which we are currently working on, because we have been told wrong requirements)

Here I am wondering... Is this normal? Is it normal to discuss the requirements the moment you have to start implementation? Or is our planning just super behind on the timeline, and would need to get further ahead?

328,Massive-Librarian-98,sbeibp,How to choose a versioning mechanism?,"We are developing a cross platform CLI tool (in GO) and a docker image which should work together. You are welcome to check the project on [Github](https://github.com/up9inc/mizu). Currently we are using semver, but abusing it and I will explain.

We have develop and main branches. On each push to develop CI increments the ""**patch**"" number of semver and publish a new ""**Pre-release**"" version for both CLI and docker, **both will have the same version** (e.g 0.1.1, 0.1.2, 0.1.3, etc..). On each push to main CI increments the ""**minor**"" number of the semver and publishes a new ""**Stable""** version for both CLI and docker (e.g 0.2.0, 0.3.0, 0.4.0, etc..). As you can probably guess there are several problems with this method, for instance if we need to deploy a ""hotfix""/”patch” we will push the fix to main and the minor version will be increased (for instance making 0.2.0 less advanced than 0.1.22).

So the requirements are, having two components CLI and docker which need to work together, having both ""stable"" and ""unstable"" releases.

What I would need is a bot that ill give my own login info to so that it chats with people (facebook page, and even in the personal inbox), as me, and is not restricted.

What I intend to achieve are the following:

1. FB PAGE followups where customers that does not respond after a few days gets chatted up with followup messages until the say NOT INTERESTED. This is very important and we do this a lot manually and more often than not, customers appreciated our followups because they are reminded of the matter.
2. FB Personal INbox - Send images coming from an API, where if we post something on our website (images or links) the bot will send chat message alerting specific GROUP CHATs of the new content. FOR EXAMPLE, we have surveyors in the field and when they take pictures of project sites on our App, our App, through the FB BOT, will post the pictures on our Group Chat to let the engineers known of new site data.

345,mrshickadance412,s79q4h,How do you capture Business KPIs/Metrics in your systems (bonus for microservices)?,"Hi everyone, 

I'm curious about recommended strategies for capturing **business** metrics in applications, especially in highly distributed / microservice-based systems. The ideal world is that we can come up with business metrics/KPIs and then create dashboards to reflect those as we build to measure against the KPIs. 

I'll try to explain through an example: Let's say it's an application that supports several task-oriented workflows. Metrics like the number of tasks created, time from task creation to completion, etc. Then, each workflow might have its own domain-centric metrics based on the data gathered during the tasks/workflow. Each domain's workflow/tasks interact with various services that support those specific domains. aka it's very distributed and the process might start in Service A, but end up in Service D, E, F based on the workflow. 

The specific example isn't too important as is the concept that it's a very distributed application with related but different domains and the start/finish can be highly variable. 

**Added context**: The system in question is very backend process-heavy, so there's a lot going on in the background. A given process can also have many touchpoints, many different users, and downtime between processes. So, it can't just be measured from Point A to Point B on the FE is a single session. 

**Options Explored**:

* FE solutions like Google Analytics to capture events will only give a small piece of the overall process since much of it is BE processing, events, etc.
* Datadog, Dynatrace type services have custom metrics. This is the closest thing I've found, but it still feels like it's not set up to handle metrics across services. Where the metric might start in Service A, but end in Service D, E, or F.

354,RationalFragile,s38ezb,Is supporting macOS worth it for indie software development?,"Hi!

I have heard many times that supporting Linux can be financially unreasonable for some companies and developers because of its low market share and disproportional technical issues. And if you need to rewrite 30% of your code to support a new operating system/platform but it will add less than 5% to your sales in the most ideal situation, it would indeed make very little sense to do so.

**But what about macOS?**

I'm currently making a tool for digital artists, and I know some of them might be using macOS. But, if market share statistics are to be believed - and assuming macOS isn't specifically preferred by digital artists - then one would expect less than 15% of clients to be on macOS.

Although I'm using frameworks that work on all the three OSes, a considerable chunk of my code is OS specific. So I'm considering only supporting Windows initially. And only adding support for other OSes when there is sufficient demand.

What do you think about this line of reasoning?

I know some of this is subjective but what I'm trying to gather is how some of these concepts fit together?

This is my current understanding. Please poke holes in it:

1. Developer works off a feature branch
2. Developer runs test locally and creates a Pull Request
3. Reviewer pulls down feature branch and runs it manually
4. Review approves PR and merges into develop
5. Automated tests are ran
6. Dev is deployed
7. When ready to release, a PR is created for Prod
8. dev is merged to master and automated tests are run again
9. master is deployed to production env

So my questions are:

1. Would you generally create a hook to run automated tests before the developer even pushes their feature branch to remote? Or is running automated tests at every step of the way overkill?
2.

Recently, the global QA team asked us to prepare ""unit tests"" for each of the stories. What we we're actually asked to do, was to go trough each feature's functionality on actual live site of this brand on indicated country, and prepare an excel file including a description of each ""unit test""  understood as ""functionality description"". Now, when we are implementing each feature, we have to go through each ""unit test"" and taking screenshots of each result for each of the language version, both for PC and mobile. They claimed it to be necessary to lower the number of bugs reported. The thing is, as a result we spent much more time on our tickets, but the number of bugs reported is not really lower. QA team often doubles the the tickets reports of the same bug, and sometimes they seem not to pay attention to what is happening on out Kanban board and in tickets' comments. They sometimes make us work with people who have almost no experience in IT field.

Also, the client made us report time spent working ""per ticket"", we did that ""per project"" before. They want us to learn new technology and won't pay for that, but prioritize projects' progress more. As a result, we can learn only if there is no work on the project at the moment.

For anyone unaware, FordPass is a mobile application for 2018+ Ford Vehicles that allows you to fetch information like fuel range, oil life, tire pressure, door unlock status, etc. You also have the ability to remotely stop, start, unlock and lock your vehicle directly from the app.

However, as of late the application front-end doesn't function properly and it makes it almost impossible to correctly authorize your vehicle, or even send remote commands. So, I decided to build an SDK that allows individuals to be able to interact and control their own vehicles using the FordPass API endpoints. This SDK bypasses the FordPass app issues and allows you to take control of your vehicle.

There are currently two versions of the ConnectedCar SDK that are currently available on Github.

1. [connected-car-node-sdk](https://github.com/ianjwhite99/connected-car-node-sdk)
2. [connected-car-python-sdk](https://github.com/ianjwhite99/connected-car-python-sdk)

&#x200B;

**The question**: What sort of operational items do development teams have that make them development teams? I'm leading this project and I really want this to be legitimate and successful so I want to incorporate anything I can that makes developers successful in a  true development position. I've never been an actual developer, I'm a mostly self taught coder that came from the investment management world. More background below, but the **TL/DR is**: ""*company I work for wants to try having the risk management team develop their own risk management software instead of our dedicated tech teams. First go of it went really well, but sloppy. How do I legitimize, any resources for where to look?*"" 

&#x200B;

I work for a semi-large company in the finance world with some pretty gross old tech. They have an entire technology division that manages our primary systems. However, most teams; sales, operations, risk management, finance, etc. end up needing new tools built rather frequently and budget / personnel constraints make it very difficult to get a hold of new tech / custom software. That said, a few people (myself included) will build ad-hoc tools, mostly out of excel and VBA to automate tasks or enhance processes. I, however, know Python, plus some front end languages and SQL. And I've recently been tasked with re-writing some of our more critical home-brew tools into python applications. 

&#x200B;

Now this has gone rather well and virtually everyone in the company was super pleased with the results and are now extremely interested in the potential. So this has become a primary function of my role and I'll be doing the same replacement with other tools. I have other members of my team that will be shifting their role to assist in this as well. Now the issue is; we are SUPER segregated from our technology teams, and from what I'm hearing they aren't super keen to have finance analysts, project managers, and compliance people getting access to the tech side of the house and developing their own tools in their environment. Which is understandable, but it seems the company really wants to experiment with us.

So I understand a compiled language such as C# will sort an array of objects much quicker than say, JavaScript. But let's say we have an array of maximum 100 objects. Each of these objects has 10-20 attributes and there isn't too much nesting going on.  


How noticeable would the difference be?

  
I kind of imagine it would be negligible and would actually be quicker overall to do on the front-end when you include the fact it would involve one API call as opposed to two.  


At what point does it start becoming beneficial to do more things from the backend?

412,tangleofcode,r5s1sk,Unit testing with production data,"Hi.

We're developing an analysis type of software, in which we fetch data from the database, and run some analysis on it.

For our unit tests, it's very hard to create fake or anonymized data, so I'm thinking maybe we simply should use production data in our tests. We'd basically do something like this in our tests:

1. We create a database mock that returns the real production data. Typically this data would be a file export from the real SQL query
2. We run this data though our code under test, and verify the output

Of course, we'd have to make sure not to add the production data to our git repo.

On the one hand, this sounds ok, but it means we have to maintain test data somewhere outside of the repo, which is a hazzle. Plus, using production data in a unit test doesn't sound right, but having to create fake data sounds even worse.

So, how have other developers handled this sort of issue before?

I'm new to this sub, hopefully this is the right place to post about this topic.

I'm a QA engineer and making the transition from manual testing to automated testing. I'm working on test automation for a fairly new product at my company, and would like some advice from more experienced QA engineers about how to get started.

So a little background - at the company I'm working at, testing has been completely manual until now. Not even unit testing. Automated testing is something we are just starting with now.

Now, I am required to write automated E2E test for a dashboard that has its own backend which integrates with a few other projects in our company and other services (such as a database, S3, monitoring). For example, a user can do CRUD actions in this dashboard, that result in items being created / updated / deleted in other systems.

This really stumps me, when it comes to testing, because the results of these scenarios are on another system, and not on the one that under test. How would you approach testing such a system? Is it better off to mock these integrations, and test them through a different method (maybe even manually)? Are there other ways to go about this?

419,evanlott,r1a203,Which Kubernetes object storage solution?,"At work we have a Kubernetes cluster which we deploy our system to. We have a devops team that manages the cluster. They are exposing an IBM GPFS/spectrum scale mount path (/path) to the cluster nodes for us to use to persist data for some amount of time. For all intents and purposes, this GPFS mount is just ""local"" storage to us. Let's say it's 1TiB of physical disk space. Now, we have many developers who may deploy test builds of our app to the test cluster in their own personal namespaces. We will also say that each deployment dynamically provisions a persistent volume for that deployment to claim, call it a 50GiB slice. My question is what is a good object/file storage solution to use that would facilitate data storage/retrieval via some API, be backed by these PVs per each deployment that can automatically ""age-off/purge"" the data after some amount of time, and while also being distributed in a way that the pods can be spread across the cluster nodes for high availability if a node goes down for some reason? I was looking into a distributed MinIO cluster, but you can't disable the erasure coding and the disk space hit we would take would be too much overhead according to the devops team (GPFS is handling redundancy and resiliency of data). I have looked into various solutions such as Rook + Ceph, OpenIO, and GlusterFS, but all the examples that I've seen deal with the devops configuration side of things rather than deploying the solution along with our system as a ""cluster"" of pods to utilize the PVs and facilitate storage/retrieval with auto data age-off. The docs are also seem to be extremely dense, so I'd rather pick something that I know can handle our use case before completely diving in to save time. This is my first time having to deal with creating a storage ""service"" on Kubernetes aside from a simple PV and PVC setup to persist some data, so I apologize for any ambiguity or lack of general knowledge on the matter. Any feedback or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

Edit: I guess the solution doesn't *have* to be deployed as part of our system, but the idea is we'd like to have control over how the storage gets sliced up without having to go through the devops team (say if a new hire joins, now we split the storage 6 ways instead of 5, etc). We also want the control over managing our ""buckets"" and how long our data can exist in the buckets before being aged-off.

434,csW1zard,qr2y71,A guide for Software Development,"Hello guy’s, I am a computer science student and even though I have classes like programming and software development I have no idea how to approach a software project the right way. They teach us the syntax and semantics of different languages and some project management techniques but not how you develop a software product for real. 

So I‘d like to start a thread which discusses the different approaches on software development and maybe create something like a compelling roadmap for developing a software product. I‘d love to see some useful responses, that new developers and those just starting out can fall back on and take guidance. 

To start this off I‘d like to provide a fake scenario to base the advice on.

Scenario: 
I‘m new to the whole development thing but am ready to learn anything it takes to bring my idea to life. I have an understanding of what my application should look like, what the base feature set is and what my target audience is. I know that I‘ll need some kind of database, a compelling UI and an functioning backend. The application should be web based and scalability should be considered. 

That’s the basic scenario, if this happens to be not enough information I‘d gladly think of some extra stuff. Just let me know.

To help get the thread rolling here are some questions that I Heard many students ask:

- What is a good way to visualise my idea?
- How to document all my ideas and build a compelling concept?
- How to decide which tech stack to use?
- Where do I start when developing a software from scratch?

&#x200B;

In our upcoming data analysis project, we'll be creating a bunch of database views, many of which will likely be reused in different parts of our software. Many of the views will be queried by other database views as well. 

As the project grows, we need to have a strict (naming) policy so that we don't end with a total mess of views that's hard to reuse and hard to figure out which business problem it solves. 

Likely, we'll maintain some soft of SQL script in our application source code, which will (re-)create the views as needed. In this script file we can add comments as needed.

We are doing a rework of our current software platform at our company. At this point, it is a Vue.js front-end client with a Laravel back-end REST API. There are three kind of users (defined by permissions).

At this moment, the Vue.js front-end is very big and messy. There is a lot of complexity and clutter.  For example: we are having the functionalities of all the three user types in one view file. Lot's of components and conditional based on the permissions of the user. The thing is: the functionalities have nothing to do with each other really. We have been brainstorming and we came up with the following idea:

We make three separate clients for each type of user: normal users, companies and admins. They all use the same back-end with different REST API endpoints (normal user endpoints, company endpoints and admin endpoints). There won't be 'double' maintenance, since all the three clients are very different from one another. Also, it can happen that one client may be updated frequently based on business needs, while the other one (such as the admin panel) may remain the same for a while.

Is this a good decision and approach? Or are there risks or issues that we are missing here?

464,quality_engineer,qfip0q,AI/ML in Software Test Automation - hype and snake oil?,"Hey /r/softwaredevelopment 

I've been implementing various types of test automation my entire career, first a Microsoft, then Expedia, then as a consultant at Thoughtworks, now at Slalom Build. (ok, I'm post-technical)

The highly exaggerated claims of AI/ML in test automation have started to annoy me.  For example:   
 

* *\[this tool\] authors tests with a few clicks: Choose a flow in your app — our AI will prebuild the test for you. Add assertions, change test data, reorganize the flow and run in minutes. Tests are fully customizable with little-to-no code required.*
* *90% faster authoring of low code E2E tests with AI-powered stability*
* *Create automated tests that survive almost any UI change and are literally “unbreakable.” Create tests with a virtual and constant retestID, that replaces ugly CSS or XPATH classifiers. No page-object pattern, no manual abstraction.*
* *\[this tool\] lets testing teams easily create and execute exponentially more tests than they can with current automation. AI Scripting: 1000x productivity improvement, Test Designer: 10x productivity improvement, Unified Testing: 3x productivity improvement.*

Here's my blunt evaluation of these tools: 

[https://medium.com/slalom-build/ai-ml-in-software-test-automation-979d18396ffa](https://medium.com/slalom-build/ai-ml-in-software-test-automation-979d18396ffa)

The TL;DR is that most of these tools are not appropriate for organizations doing actual software development, and are used to dumb down test automation by combining low/no-code features and AI/ML marketing hype.  If you build software, stick with open source, code-first tools.   


Summary, so you don't have to click the link if you don't want to:   
 

>It should be obvious that many claims on the benefits of AI/ML in testing and test automation are exaggerated. It seems that some vendors include AI/ML language in product descriptions simply for the marketing value, and those AI/ML tools do not represent any tangible improvement over earlier generations of products.  
>  
>However, there are still legitimate vendors using AI/ML to improve software testing and test automation. The challenge for all test managers, automation architects, and engineering leaders will be separating out false promises and marketing material from legitimate products that provide real benefits, while ensuring tools’ benefits are actually relevant to the needs and challenges of their teams. In many cases, the answer to this will be ‘no’.  
>  
>Do not be afraid of being labeled old fashioned because you require proof of the value of AI/ML and the tools that leverage these algorithms. AI/ML is an exciting technology and it’s application within the domain of software testing and test automation will undoubtedly add value *somewhere.* Unfortunately, as with any new technology, that value is hidden within an ocean of questionable ideas, exaggerations, false starts, and people simply exploiting the excitement to make money.

Even though im included on the developments process as a programmer currently (not very experienced, but have some projects up and running mainly on .NET and java-selenium), i have no idea on what would be the best architecture layout i should use for the specifics i need on the new software. 

I tried to talk with a company who directs on these kind of things, but they didnt offer me a price list as for now and their 'free 30min consulting' was not supposed for new starters or startups.

I'd like to build a qualitative software, with security and maintenance as its first priorities, since its going to be used by serious costumers with frequent need to update and fix bugs. That would include picking the best programming language, database systems, CI/CD, architecture design etc..

Ive been thinking on hiring the devs accordingly, but without knowing with what is the best tech stack to do so, hiring is also hard to do correctly. 

In your opinion, what is the best approach to start this idea and develop. Should i secure some funding to pay off a company which, based on my requirements for the app, would give me some idea on the tech stack to use. I currently live in Balkans so funding is also limited before actually building something. 

One more thing this has been stopping me to start find the findings, is also the type of programmers i would need to hire, estimated time to finish the project.

Ive made this post in a rush, so if you need extra info ill gladly answer.

475,Western-Wishbone-765,qbxw9j,Startup - testing - unittesting habits & best practices?,"I'm a CTO in a tiny startup, and curious about what others have learned about testing in startups. We've been around for two years and currently there are 3 fulltime developers, including me. Our codebase is < 500 000 lines and it's purely backend written mostly in Java.

Personally I've written unit tests only when developing a complex datastructure or some other (business-)critical part of the system. One developer in our team pays a lot of attention on unit testing, and writes huge amounts of unit tests. I respect his opinion, and I've given him the time to create the tests he  thinks is necessary.  I just think most of what he is doing is waste of (current) resources, as having bugs in non-business critical parts of the code is not so important, and some of the things he is testing with unit tests, would be a lot quicker to test with basic integration tests before merging code to master. Because he is writing the unit tests, he delivers new features much slower than others.

So I'm curious to hear, from startup CTO's, how have you successfully combined the lack of resources and testing in a startup? Or how has the lack of (unit / other) tests destroyed a startup? Or from developers working in startups, what kind of unit tests are you writing, and how do you feel about it?",11,4,2021-10-20 13:37:46,startup   testing   unittesting habits   best practices ,i m a cto in a tiny startup  and curious about what others have learned about testing in startups  we ve been around for two years and currently there are  fulltime developers  including me  our codebase is     lines and it s purely backend written mostly in java personally i ve written unit tests only when developing a complex datastructure or some other  business  critical part of the system  one developer in our team pays a lot of attention on unit testing  and writes huge amounts of unit tests  i respect his opinion  and i ve given him the time to create the tests he  thinks is necessary   i just think most of what he is doing is waste of  current  resources  as having bugs in non business critical parts of the code is not so important  and some of the things he is testing with unit tests  would be a lot quicker to test with basic integration tests before merging code to master  because he is writing the unit tests  he delivers new features much slower than others so i m curious to hear  from startup cto s  how have you successfully combined the lack of resources and testing in a startup  or how has the lack of  unit   other  tests destroyed a startup  or from developers working in startups  what kind of unit tests are you writing  and how do you feel about it

I'm curious if anyone has an API documentation workflow they are willing to share that includes the Postman tool for publishing.

I'd like a workflow that works as smoothly as possible with minimal mandatory manual steps. Currently I'm familiar with the Swagger toolchain for automatically generating OpenAPI specification, and I know that you can then import that into Postman as a collection.

From there we can use additional functionality that Postman offers like writing tests, adding extra examples, using environments etc. 

One concern is that reimporting the OpenAPI specification if you make a change to the service 's API may overwrite the extra functionality.

&#x200B;

1. What's your workflow like?
2. How do you structure Postman across the org? I'm thinking a workspace per team, with each team owning a collection for each service in their jurisdiction.

483,CodeMonkey24816,q8m2vk,Are others writing tests in 2021? Is it improving your quality of living?,"In my personal development workflow I am constantly writing tests (unit, integration, e2e), but I'm finding less and less people and teams who also share this philosophy. Does anyone else still write lots and lots of tests as part of their workflow?

The part that is confusing to me is that these same people are constantly complaining about the challenges they face on their projects, and the challenges are almost always helped or even eliminated by writing quality tests. From my perspective tests aren't just for customer/stakeholder/manager satisfaction. They are something I require for me to complete my daily work reliably and consistently. I'm not writing them for others, I'm doing it for myself.

Does anyone else find that writing tests has sped up your workflows drastically, and that it has made code updates drastically easier? Does anyone else find that it makes communication and planning easier? Does anyone else find that tests make predicting your efforts and estimates much easier and accurate?

These same non-testing teams usually want to implement CI/CD into their workflows also, which by definition requires quality automated testing. Am I missing something though? Has anyone implemented a fully automated system that didn't incorporate automated testing?

I love continuous delivery, it has drastically improved my quality of life. I no longer have stressful deployments that require staying after hours, working weekends, or participating in work that contributes to stress and poor mental health. The time it takes me to get work to production is consistently much lower than my peers who aren't practicing continuous delivery. I couldn't get these benefits without solid testing in place though. Does this line up with what others are experiencing in their day to day workflows?

Has anyone ever seen a really large, stable, and complex application/system that didn't have lots of quality tests? Has anyone ever seen a small, stable, production ready application/system that didn't have lots of quality tests? Has anyone seen an application/system that users loved, but it didn't have lots of quality tests?

I know this post is kind of a ramble, but it feels like I'm going crazy. It's kind of stressful and depressing to watch the same pattens unfold. I'm watching my peers continuously struggle with the same things in every project, and it doesn't have to be that way for them. These are people that I think are really talented and that I love to work with. They have so much potential and are genuinely great people. Every time I bring up testing though, I hear excuses and resistance. They blame it on the customer, the management, the circumstances, the size of the company, time, money, other developers, the code, the language, the platform, and the list goes on. I've tried to lead by example, I've tried to help with training, I've tried active and passive communication approaches, I've provided supporting data from really large research efforts like the DORA effort. What else can I try? How can I help? Has anyone else been successful at helping others to see the need and the value?

I am studying agile scrum methodology for software development. Coming from a waterfall background, I found something confusing.

Suppose, I am building an application that requires user authentication. So the user story will be like this:

""As a User, I want to register to the website using my mobile number and password so that I can use the system""

Now the problem is, there will be some sort of functionalities behind this single user story. For example, OTP should be sent to user mobile number for verification is a sub-requirement. This thing is not written in the user story.

498,gaySaipan,px0fze,Can you recommend a soft to create an interactive menu for a small business?,"Hi everybody! I hope that this subreddit is an excellent place to get some piece of advice. The thing is that I’ve recently opened my own bar. To attract more customers, I wanna add there some sort of interactive menu. I’m looking for a soft that can help me out with that. I’m pretty sure some apps can help to design a digital menu for bars. I just don’t know which one to choose.

&#x200B;

Besides, I wanna place an outdoor screen with some unique cocktails that I make by myself. I’ve finished bartenders schools, and sometimes I experiment with mixers to create something extraordinary. My GF takes excellent photos of it, and we post them on our Instagram account. So, the plan is to upload our drinks, so they can be visible from outdoors. I’ve already found this company [kitcast.tv](https://kitcast.tv) that might help me with that.

&#x200B;

But I need at least a good photo editing app or some software that helps to create a menu in a digital format. It would be great if you could offer me something easy to use, so non-professional will do something with it. I need to edit pictures before I send them away for the screen. I really hope that this idea can help me attract new customers. As far as I know, this is really efficient with some restaurants. Basically, this digital screen somehow affects customers, so they can decide spontaneously and try something in that particular place without planning anything in advance. I’ve seen this thing working on others. It works on me too. That’s why I wanna add this to my bar. But I need some apps that will allow me to do 50% of the work by myself and edit the menu without third-party help. My budget is limited, and I need to also pay wages to staff, rent, and credits I applied for to open this business.

501,mrshickadance412,pwnwju,What do your Scaled Trunk-Based CICD Pipelines look like?,"Hi, I'm curious how teams are supporting a [Scaled Trunk Based](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/#scaled-trunk-based-development) model with their CICD, what they are automating, what they are not, etc. 

We use CircleCI, we have a Test, Beta (pre-Prod), and Prod environment. Our short-lived feature branches are built, unit tested, sonar-scanned. Once merged to trunk they are deployed to Test, and system tests/acceptance tests are run. 

To get to Beta, a release branch is opened, and it basically does the Test process, then deploys to Beta, runs the Beta system tests, and waits for approval to deploy to Prod.

We don't really leverage tags, or do a great job of tying deployments back to source control (Github). I'd like to do that but then questions start to arise in:

* When exactly do we tag? Beta deployment, Production deployment?
* What if there are accidentally two release branches open at once? Would that mess up the tags?
* What type of tagging to use? Semantic versioning, just a datetime stamp, etc?
* On the release branch, should we skip the test env? Deploying there will potentially overwrite the trunk deployment there. This is probably up to us, but I'm not sure it's worth re-deploying there. 

All in all, it just seems like a common paradigm, but I don't see many examples/templates/best practices out there to support it. And, I just want to get off on the right foot if possible and avoid dumb mistakes. Or, just hear about clever solutions that engineers like working with. Thanks!

503,Square_Mountain2547,pukgne,Tips to Run Daily Scrum Meeting Effectively,"&#x200B;

It can be hard for new teams to decide on a Daily Scrum format, so here are some recommendations that work well.

* **Focus on the Sprint Goal.** This is the most important thing that should drive you during the Daily Scrum. The main output from this event is a plan for the next 24 hours that will help achieve this goal. It’s a good practice for every Developer to explain what they did in the last 24 hours and what they will do in the next to get closer to the Sprint Goal.
* **Use a Scrum board with the “Walk the Board” approach.** A Scrum board helps people concentrate on current tasks. We suggest using the “Walk the Board” approach, where the team walks through all the work items on the board from right to left. The work items that are closest to “done” are discussed first. This helps identify impediments and keep everyone concentrated on completing tasks to move them to the Closed column. Try to avoid only using ticket numbers to refer to tasks; this makes your updates generic and provides less value to the rest of your team.
* **Start using Work Item Age for your tickets on the board.** During Daily meetings, pay attention to and discuss tickets with the highest Work Item Age to understand why they are taking longer and how this will impact the Sprint Goal. What actions do you need to include in the plan for the next 24 hours to proceed with these tickets?
* **Do a brief review of past work.** Developers run the application and inspect its state. Let every Developer describe their part of the work, discuss, and agree on next steps towards the Sprint Goal.
* **Developers speak freely, not according to a set schedule or called upon by the Scrum Master. Developers independently pass the word to each other.** Why do we use this approach at Exadel? First of all, people start listening to each other, at least to remember who hasn’t talked yet. Secondly, eventually it helps build self-management skills.
* **Daily Scrum is not a problem-solving meeting; it’s about identifying a problem.** Many teams book time right after the Daily Scrum to discuss outstanding issues and work on resolution.

**Use the Fist to Five method.** It helps measure the team’s level of confidence that the Sprint Goal will be achieved and gives a great insight if something has gone wrong. It is also a good input for the Sprint Retrospective.",2,3,2021-09-24 17:04:15,tips to run daily scrum meeting effectively,  xb it can be hard for new teams to decide on a daily scrum format  so here are some recommendations that work well     focus on the sprint goal    this is the most important thing that should drive you during the daily scrum  the main output from this event is a plan for the next  hours that will help achieve this goal  it s a good practice for every developer to explain what they did in the last  hours and what they will do in the next to get closer to the sprint goal     use a scrum board with the  walk the board  approach    a scrum board helps people concentrate on current tasks  we suggest using the  walk the board  approach  where the team walks through all the work items on the board from right to left  the work items that are closest to  done  are discussed first  this helps identify impediments and keep everyone concentrated on completing tasks to move them to the closed column  try to avoid only using ticket numbers to refer to tasks  this makes your updates generic and provides less value to the rest of your team     start using work item age for your tickets on the board    during daily meetings  pay attention to and discuss tickets with the highest work item age to understand why they are taking longer and how this will impact the sprint goal  what actions do you need to include in the plan for the next  hours to proceed with these tickets     do a brief review of past work    developers run the application and inspect its state  let every developer describe their part of the work  discuss  and agree on next steps towards the sprint goal     developers speak freely  not according to a set schedule or called upon by the scrum master  developers independently pass the word to each other    why do we use this approach at exadel  first of all  people start listening to each other  at least to remember who hasn t talked yet  secondly  eventually it helps build self management skills     daily scrum is not a problem solving meeting  it s about identifying a problem    many teams book time right after the daily scrum to discuss outstanding issues and work on resolution   use the fist to five method    it helps measure the team s level of confidence that the sprint goal will be achieved and gives a great insight if something has gone wrong  it is also a good input for the sprint retrospective 
504,JerLam2762,pu0h3k,Should we make our project open source?," Hi everyone,

I  hope you are well. We're thinking about a question with my teammates  and I think your opinions and advice can be very relevant. It's in the  title: we are thinking of putting our product in open source. For  context, I'll describe our solution in 3 points (without naming it or  putting a link to avoid being accused of self-promotion):

1/ Our product aggregates various AI APIs (computer vision, NLP, speech-to-text, etc.) into a single API.

2/ It includes a feature that dynamically directs the data processing request to the ""optimal"" provider.

3/ It offers a reseller contract that allows access to a multitude of services with a single account.

We  are thinking of putting the first one in open source to allow  developers to have the aggregator (having in this case to create several  accounts with different providers and without taking advantage of the  automatic recommendation). This guarantees a ""continuity of service"" if  by misfortune our company stops. And above all, it would build a  community around our product.

But  at the same time, we try to measure the potential risk (in relation to  potential competitors in particular). Maybe there are some issues we  haven't thought of?

What do you think about it? What would be your advice? Thanks in advance to those who will take the time to answer me.

Thanks,

507,Zardotab,pryan1,"Software Dev. is a Racket (yes, an ""old guy"" rant)","I notice the amount of code and time to create small and medium-sized business software has been going noticeably *up* since the 1990's, not down. It's like **Moore's Law in reverse**. CRUD principles haven't changed that much, but stacks ignore YAGNI, DRY, and KISS and have made CRUD harder instead of easier. One spends too much development time on tech minutia and battling UI's instead of domain logic itself. 

I will agree there's more choice now, but the cost of choice seems huge. Most apps don't need all the what-if's the bloaters brag about. I doubt most biz owners would want to pay 3x more for all those what-if's. (Nor am I sure it's an either-or choice.)

Warren Buffett noticed the same about finance: it's a fad machine that processes suckers. He got rich by letting his competitors waste into fads. He's not afraid to say ""no"" to industry peer pressure or Fear-Of-Being-Left-Behind 🕰️👹. The hucksters use the same techniques that trick 35% of the population into thinking the vaccine and election are rigged. Humans are suckers, and IT fad pushers know this.

The industry is pressured to sell books, new software versions, how-to videos, video ads, etc. Publishers of how-to content would lose their livelihood if new features or techniques were vetted in a more scientific way rather than ""it's what all the kool kids are doing!"". Here's a partial list of resource-wasting fads:

* Microservices are mostly a JSON-ized version of the XML-web-services-everywhere fad of the early 2000's. It mostly failed for the same reasons [Microservices often go sour](https://www.reddit.com/r/microservices/comments/psqw3u/i_cant_get_a_clear_definition_of_microservice/). Microservices are a sub-fad of the ""Netflixification"" of our stacks. What works for a billion users (Netflix) is mega-overkill for 1,000 users. Bloating code with ""Async/await"" everywhere is also a symptom of this disease. 

* People started [throwing out RDBMS](https://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/06/03/the-problem-is-not-the-tool-itself/) for the ""NoSql"" movement in the early 2010's, and when the systems matured, they realized they actually needed many features of traditional RDBMS after all. And RDBMS have since added more distributed features. (It was more about ""DBA's don't let us move fast and brake things"", but when your biz matures, you do want to stop breaking things.)

* Space-wasting UI's optimized for fingers (mobile) instead of mouse. This results in more scrolling, paging, and more screens to get things done. It maybe okay for bedroom social media, but are crappy for in-office productivity where 90% still use mice. 🐭 Mice didn't die, only productivity did. The web still can't do real GUI's for office work without bloated buggy JS libraries.

* ""Responsive design"" turned the bicycle science of WYSIWYG into rocket science. Now you need to hire a dedicated UI expert to get decent UI's. I've rarely seen a generalist master responsive. Most businesses I know only need about 10% of screens on mobile, so why drag down the other 90%? Because they were told real GUI's are ""obsolete"". 

* OOP was poorly understood yet was shoehorned into everything when it first came out because everyone feared being left off the OOP Train. It's since been learned it's not very good at domain modelling, which is where it was first pushed. Many companies were left with OOP spaghetti code. OOP has its place, but took a while to figure out where that is.

* ""Functional programming"" keeps coming back in style every 25 years or so, looks great on paper, but fails on real teams. One problem is it's harder to debug because it lacks intermediate ""state"" to x-ray via debuggers for clues.

512,YNedderhoff,pru47k,Does @SpringBootTest encourage bad testing practices?,"With a few colleagues we recently discussed a few approaches to testing Spring Boot applications using the example of a simple CRUD API. We tend to normally do

1. unit testing using [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/), which typically means that all dependencies of a class are mocked
2. integration tests using tools such as [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) and [RestAssured](https://rest-assured.io/). Run dependencies such as a database in a testcontainer, make API calls using rest assured and check what ended up in the database by having some code that connects to the database directly (not via the CRUD API)

With that approach, both the unit and the integration tests don't have any dependencies on other application code and test exactly what they are supposed to test. 

But there are also people who love the `@SpringBootTest` annotation. It's used in a lot of tutorials, so naturally junior developers often end up using it. It's useful for some special cases, but in my opinion it encourages bad testing practices. The main issue I have with it that it easily lets you 1. load and 2. modify the entire application context. It leads to really smelly tests written by inexperienced developers, that end up just autowiring a lot of the application code dependencies and use those for assertions. 

Simple example: Someone might write a test by spinning a database up with Testcontainers, making an API call to insert some data and use the autowired repository to check if the data inserted is correct. What they don't think about is that as they are using application code to verify application code, then if the application code is buggy the tests are buggy and a potential issue might not be caught.

So in short, my feeling is that `@SpringBootTest` encourages bad testing practices by making it way to easy to use application code in places where really it shouldn't be used.

# Tips for Sprint Retrospective Meetings

Hi, guys! Just want to share some tips for Scrum Master performing the Sprint Retrospective )

* Be prepared. The Retrospective is one of the most important events in Scrum. If you don’t do it at all or don’t do it efficiently, you are depriving your team of voice. Create a facilitation plan for each Retrospective and make sure your team completes each step.
* Explain the Vegas Rule to your Team: “what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.” Whatever is said in the meeting must be kept private among the participants and should never be repeated to others. There is no exception to this rule. It encourages trust and honest feedback, and the Team needs to be sure they won’t be judged. A Retrospective is a safe place for everyone.
* Make someone responsible for each action item. Without assigning responsibility, it’s likely that everyone will assume that someone else will handle it, and your action items will never actually get implemented.
* Don’t forget to review action items from previous Retrospectives to see whether they were solved or not. Autonomy and accountability hand in hand.
* If your team says they don’t need Retrospectives because they have nothing to improve, remember that perfection has no bounds.",3,3,2021-09-17 10:49:20,tips for sprint retrospective meetings  ,   tips for sprint retrospective meetingshi  guys  just want to share some tips for scrum master performing the sprint retrospective    be prepared  the retrospective is one of the most important events in scrum  if you don t do it at all or don t do it efficiently  you are depriving your team of voice  create a facilitation plan for each retrospective and make sure your team completes each step   explain the vegas rule to your team   what happens in vegas  stays in vegas   whatever is said in the meeting must be kept private among the participants and should never be repeated to others  there is no exception to this rule  it encourages trust and honest feedback  and the team needs to be sure they won t be judged  a retrospective is a safe place for everyone   make someone responsible for each action item  without assigning responsibility  it s likely that everyone will assume that someone else will handle it  and your action items will never actually get implemented   don t forget to review action items from previous retrospectives to see whether they were solved or not  autonomy and accountability hand in hand   if your team says they don t need retrospectives because they have nothing to improve  remember that perfection has no bounds 
516,ascendixtech,ppf8z5,"Fleet Management Software Development: Providers, Features, Costs","Many companies have started investing large funds into fleet management software as it helps automate most daily tasks, reduce operational costs, and increase customer satisfaction.

According to the Fortune Business Insights report, the fleet management software market has reached the level of $16.9 bln in 2020 and is projected to exceed $19.6 bln by the end of 2021

For this reason, we decided to cover the topic of fleet management software development covering such topics as:

* Fleet management software definition
* Best fleet management software solutions
* Must-have logistics management software functionality
* Fleet management software costs
* Key steps to build your own fleet management system.

Let's get down to business.

## What Is Fleet Management Software

In simple terms, fleet management software (FMS) is a cloud-based software solution that enables organizations to track and administrate all vehicles, drivers, and technicians in one place.

Let's take a look at the key things you can automate and monitor in real-time:

* Current vehicle location and route direction with GPS tracking
* Current speed, temperature, fuel level and usage, door opening
* Driver hours of service (HOC) and power take-off
* Many others.

**What are the top fleet management solutions?**

Many companies see vivid benefits in using out-of-the-box fleet management systems that provide ready-made functionality within relatively easy and fast setup.

Here is the list of the most popular and famous fleet management software solutions in the market:

* Fleetio
* USFleetTracking
* Rhino Fleet Tracking
* Onfleet.

## Must-Have Fleet Management Software Features

**#1 Vehicle GPS tracking**

Real-time truck GPS tracking is one of the key features that helps e-commerce businesses and other companies optimize their logistics processes.

Entrepreneurs want to monitor and manage their trucks along with tracking such parameters as current vehicle location, speed, fuel usage, trip duration time, and many others.

All these demands become possible by implementing GPS tracking functionality which provides an all-inclusive next-level real-time overview tools that synchronize managers and drivers.

**#2 Driver behavior monitoring**

Simply put, drivers make one of the most crucial yet low-end routine work that allow businesses to gain profit and meet customers' demands.

This fact makes it reasonable to build driver behavior monitoring functionality which helps both a company to monitor and manage drivers real-time and drivers to get relevant recommendations and bonuses for successful plan overachievement.

So, this functionality provides the following benefits:

* Minimize the fleet collisions ratio so that companies can greatly reduce operational costs
* Get real-time metrics and generate all-inclusive reports based on deep driver behavior analysis
* Implement scoreboards for drivers to stimulate them work safely and timely by providing quarter bonuses.

**#3 Fuel management**

One of the key spending patterns for delivery companies is fuel consumption as commercial drivers make over 1,000,000 miles per year.

For this reason, fuel consumption management functionality is an essential feature for all business nowadays.

First, it helps companies to monitor all fleet trucks’ fuel levels, the average frequency of refuelling and draining, and control the fuel costs.

Second, businesses get advanced real-time insights into possible leaks and theft cases. It allows them to prevent negative risks that influence profit generation results and final customer satisfaction.

Third, fleet fuel management software enables organizations to set alarms that display warnings each time draining takes place.

**#4 Trip logging and mileage calculation functionality**

All fleet and logistics companies make use of advanced logistics algorithms to make their processes as time- and cost-effective as possible.

This way, they can greatly reduce operational costs, boost profit, and meet even more customers' demands in the long run.

All these facts makes the trip logging and mileage calculation features a must-have initiative nowadays to stay competitive in the market.

Let's briefly discuss the key benefits they provide:

* Automatically monitor and collect multiple parameters per each trip gathering them by using electronic vehicle trackers.
* Avoid time-consuming logbooks and spreadsheets by automating these processes through a trip logging feature that collects data real-time.
* Decrease labor costs and save time for fleet managers so  they focus on more major tasks like business growth and customer development.
* Reach high tax deductions, fuel savings, and performance optimization.

## Fleet Management Software Development: Key Steps

With that out of the way, it's high time to define the core steps you need to build your own powerful fleet management system.

# 1 Set your business goals

First, begin with outlining the core business challenges you currently have, goals you want to achieve, and technical requirements to the future fleet management software.

This will help you get a transparent understanding of the fleet management system pool of features that your business needs.

For instance, if you want to get an all-inclusive control and management tool that will allow you to get real-time data on fuel consumption, then fleet fuel management software is a must-have feature for your fleet management software.

# 2 Define the right software type

When you finish defining the exact set of features you need and business goals you want to achieve, you can move forward to choosing the relevant fleet management software type.

Below is the list of the most common system types:

* Delivery management
* Fleet maintenance
* Fuel management
* Route planning
* Truck dispatch software
* And others.

Most commonly, the best fleet management software providers offer multiple functionality pool in a single centralized software solution.

This means that you can access all of them by just purchasing a single license for their product.

On the other side, here comes the difference between custom and out-of-the-box fleet management software solutions.

The latter provide multiple ready-made features you may never use and just overpay for them in the long term.

In turn, custom fleet management software offer on-demand functionality and scalability opportunities yet charging larger funds initially.

The choice should depend on your current needs and business goals you want to achieve along with knowing the pros and cons of each software type.

# 3 Choose the development option

Before you start developing any tailor-made software, you should realize the most cost-effective and suitable option for your project.

Now we want to briefly cover 3 opportunities you have to start building a powerful custom logistics management system.

**1. Find a technical partner/CTO**

**2. Hire freelance development teams**

**3. Outsource to a fleet management software development company**

## Final Words

Fleet management software development is a complex and thorny way of building tailor-made functionality that caters to your business needs and challenges.

Think twice whether out-of-the-box functionality is a great option for your company and will let your enterprise grow without any limitations in the future.

I wonder what is the difference between regular unit tests to Api tests.

A unit test is mocked and thus checks only the business logic, and an api test is not mocked (right?) and thus acts as a kind of an integration test?

Postman for example allows making Api tests, but for example If would do a unit test for an entire endpoint within my Api, when everything is mocked, isn't it better than a regular Api test which checks the status code and other stateless data returning with the request, while ignoring whatever is stateful?

536,mboegers,pg2zaf,Thoughts about the Quality of Requirements,"A requirement is born on the head of a person as an idea and evolves over multiple stages into a bunch of tasks on the developer's desk. 

The customer thinks: ""He's if we have a button here, which does trigger this action, work would be much better. Let's ask for this!""
The project management use the knowledge about the big picture and their  deep knowledge about the product and includes this into a 
Specification, which in the end is approved by the customer.
This specification is split into epics, which are divided further until we end up with stories for the development team.

We see a lot of transformation, grouping and splitting. Usually, these steps are done by multiple individuals in different roles. In different projects I've seen the same effect: The path which the customer's idea takes from the customer to the development team determines the stories quality. Low-quality stories are bad on multiple layers. In the best case, they lead to frustration because of a lot of back questions. In the worst case, they lead to bad implementations or even nonsense...

547,paulboeck,pbd2ej,Is team member buy-in essential for software development teams?,"Is team member buy-in essential for software development teams?

In most cases, YES. Getting team member buy-in is a critical component to success for your team and organization. Without it, you’ll have a hard time getting things done and moving forward toward the goal(s) you've set.

If you want to get anything done in your organization, whether it be a project completed or an initiative launched, having the support of everyone involved is crucial. When people are on board with what they’re doing and why they’re doing it, there will be less resistance when change occurs (and change always occurs ) and you're way more likely to end up with a quality result. 

No, it's not important to have everyone be through the roof with rah-rah enthusiasm, but if a team member is questioning why you're asking them to do something, then there's a gap that needs to be addressed. Like NOW.

If you've got a team of good communicators, you'll hopefully hear about any confusion over or disagreement with team and organizational goals. This is the best place you can be at this point because you'll have concrete issues you can address. You can ask specific questions about specific concerns and figure out how to make the goals relevant in the face of those concerns. Or maybe, you'll realize that your team member has a valid concern or is bringing up something you haven't thought about and you'll have the opportunity to revisit the defined goal(s).

If you're managing a team of (likely) introverted software developers,  you may never hear of the objections to the team and organizational goals until it's too late. This is a BAD place to be. 

In general, when communicating new goals, you can help get team members on board by asking them questions that help them understand the importance of their work and how it fits into the big picture. You don't need to ask ""why"" questions all day long; just make sure that people know why what they're working on matters so that they can feel good about their contribution to the overall goals of the business. And make sure that they know you're open to discussing any questions or disagreements they might have.",0,0,2021-08-25 18:03:37,is team member buy in essential for software development teams ,is team member buy in essential for software development teams in most cases  yes  getting team member buy in is a critical component to success for your team and organization  without it  you ll have a hard time getting things done and moving forward toward the goal s  you ve set if you want to get anything done in your organization  whether it be a project completed or an initiative launched  having the support of everyone involved is crucial  when people are on board with what they re doing and why they re doing it  there will be less resistance when change occurs  and change always occurs   and you re way more likely to end up with a quality result  no  it s not important to have everyone be through the roof with rah rah enthusiasm  but if a team member is questioning why you re asking them to do something  then there s a gap that needs to be addressed  like now if you ve got a team of good communicators  you ll hopefully hear about any confusion over or disagreement with team and organizational goals  this is the best place you can be at this point because you ll have concrete issues you can address  you can ask specific questions about specific concerns and figure out how to make the goals relevant in the face of those concerns  or maybe  you ll realize that your team member has a valid concern or is bringing up something you haven t thought about and you ll have the opportunity to revisit the defined goal s  if you re managing a team of  likely  introverted software developers   you may never hear of the objections to the team and organizational goals until it s too late  this is a bad place to be  in general  when communicating new goals  you can help get team members on board by asking them questions that help them understand the importance of their work and how it fits into the big picture  you don t need to ask why questions all day long  just make sure that people know why what they re working on matters so that they can feel good about their contribution to the overall goals of the business  and make sure that they know you re open to discussing any questions or disagreements they might have

&#x200B;

I've been working as a backend ERP developer for several years and i've decided to work on a side project to improve my skills in several fronts where i dont have much experience at.

&#x200B;

My idea is to make kind of a fitness web where you can chat with a fitness expert, find nutritional information for foods, and where the fitness experts can sell or advertise their products (merch, workout plans, etc).

&#x200B;

So there are a couple of items that im not even sure where to start. If you could give me pointers or refer me to a tutorial similar to these i'd greatly appreciate it:

1. how to platform the ""sales"" of the products. And what i should consider for this feature.

2)how to ensure the chat is ""targeted"" so you only get to chat with specific people. Although i assume this could be done just based on some sort of user profiles, but maybe there's a better way.

&#x200B;

Just as a note im not expecting to actually make money with this, but i want to have the infrastructure as complete as possible so i can learn and also show it in a portfolio.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Should clarify that i will probably use React and Node or React and Django for this.

555,sharbytroods,p83j40,DBC is still TDD done right!,"# DBC is still TDD done right!

What follows is a real-world example where I am using DBC to understand the proper operation of reaching out to a local git log for information about a repo. Still, the code has a little twist.

Because this code reaches out to an external client (e.g. Windows OS command line), I have used a *rescue clause* to to help trap errors due to issues with the client. In this case, if the Windows OS command line fails to cooperate, the directory is unreachable for some reason, or whatever—I don't want my code to just stop. I want it to report the error through its return (e.g. Result) string.

Let's examine this function!

## The Function (Query)

>		git_log (p: PATH; d: DATE): STRING
>				-- Fetch the `git_log' from CLI.
>			require
>				exists: attached {DIRECTORY} (create {DIRECTORY}.make_with_path (p)) as al_dir and then
>						al_dir.exists and then al_dir.is_readable
>				has_git: ∃ ic:al_dir.entries ¦ ic.name.has_substring ("".git"")
>				not_today: d.days /= (create {DATE}.make_now).days
>			local
>				h: INTEGER
>				l_cmd: STRING
>				td: DATE
>			do
>				create Result.make_empty
>				h := (create {TIME}.make_now).hour
>				create td.make_now
>				d.day_back
>				check at_least_one_day_span: td.days - d.days >= 1 end
>				l_cmd := ""git log --after "" + d.out + "" --before "" + (((td.days - d.days - 2) * 24) + h).out + "".hours""
>				Result := output_of_command (l_cmd, Void)
>				log_info (Result)
>			ensure
>				has_result: not Result.is_empty
>				right_day: old d.days = (d.days + 1)
>			rescue
>				if attached l_cmd as al_cmd then
>					Result := ""ERROR: output_of_command failed%Ncmd="" + al_cmd + ""%N""
>					log_emergency (Result)
>				else
>					log_emergency (""git_log call failure on path="" + p.absolute_path.name.out + "", date="" + d.out)
>				end
>			end

## Preconditions

The preconditions are written at the top of the routine in the require clause. In this clause, I assert several critical things that must be true for this function query to return the correct result.

1. The incoming PATH must be a DIRECTORY that a) can be created, b) exists, and c) is readable.
2. At least one entry in the DIRECTORY must be named "".git"", which helps to assure me that I have a folder where a git repo exists.
3. The date argument must not be today, but sometime in the past. I use the *.days INTEGER property of the d-date because integer comparison is fast and more relevant to how I use the dates in the code below.

Especially in the implementation and testing phase, I want to know these are true whenever I reach out to the file system for a ""git log"". But remember, I can leave preconditions turned on when building the final binary and even in production have these DBC assertions operating in the finalized production app on the client system.

## Mid-Routine Check Conditions

As I read this code, I conclude that it is critical that there be a span of one or more days between today and the date argument. So, I check to see if this is true before constructing the git log command.

You can have as many of these check assertions as you like, want, or need. I like to place them at critical places where I want to ensure a routine's state midway through.

### Critical TDD vs DBC Point

The midway check assertion demonstrates something that DBC can do that TDD cannot. TDD cannot put ""test assertions"" in the middle of the code it is calling. It cannot. Period. But—DBC can, easily, simply—as you see in the example (above).

## Post-Conditions

As you look at the post-conditions in the *ensure clause*, you will need to be aware that the Result STRING is really the output of the git log command that was issued by this code to the command line. As this is true, we could ask a lot more of our Result STRING to prove or demonstrate that we have a git log output. But—in this case, I simply want to know that the Result STRING is not empty—that is—it has content. For me, that is enough. From there, I will trust.

The other thing I want to know is that the date my client caller sent was backed up by one day by the routine. If it was not, then I would like to know because it means that the git log is potentially for the wrong date range.

## Rescue (but no Retry)

If the Windows OS command line fails for some reason, my program cannot control that, but I still want to know about it. So, I use the Eiffel Rescue clause (and language grammar) to give me an indication that something went off the rails. I log this as an emergency on the logging system if there was a git log command. If (for some bizarre reason) there was no git log command, then it changes to a critical matter. Either way—I am going to log the failure.

Why just logging? Why not stopping? In this case, logging is sufficient. I don't want to crash my program, I simply want a notification that something is not right.

Note that as designers, we can have some excellent design discussions around this little function-query feature! We could discuss the design, what could go wrong, how to handle it, redundancy, and so on. All of that would be an excellent thing. I even invite you to post responses with just those kinds of thoughts and feedback!

## The TDD?

What is important for you to see is the difference between the test code and the actual production code with DBC contracts. For your edification, here is the test code for the routine above:

>		reporter_git_log_tests
>				-- test of the ""git_log"" feature.
>			note
>				testing:
>					""covers/{RIA_REPORTER}.git_log""
>			local
>				l_reporter: RIA_REPORTER
>			do
>				create l_reporter
>				assert_strings_equal (""git_log_25"", git_log_25, l_reporter.git_log (create {PATH}.make_current, create {DATE}.make (2021, 7, 25)))
>			end
>	
>		git_log_25: STRING = ""[ ... ]""

Notice how simple the test is:

1. Create a RIA_REPORTER
2. Assert that the resulting STRING returned by a call to ""git_log"" is what we expect it to be.

That's it! Nothing more is required on the TDD side. All of the interesting and relevant test assertions are living with the code as DBC contracts, including the mid-routine check assertions that TDD simply cannot do.

## CONCLUSION

All of this taken together is precisely why DBC is TDD done right. The contract assertions living in its relevant context with the code mean that no caller of the ""git_log"" function-query will miss being tested. Each new caller will still have the same pre-call requirements and post-call expectations. Nothing changes, but everything is tested—at any time and anyplace in the operation of the software or at any level of the call stack.

I sincerely hope that this little demonstration was helpful to you.

561,Hot_Echidna4115,p5yd65,"E-learning software development trends, 2021","The growth of the e-learning industry was already witnessing a frantic pace even before the pandemic. But the sudden shutdown of all the businesses, including learning institutes, has accelerated it further. It has given more space for the e-learning industry to grow. The opportunity can be understood by the data of Global Market insight that indicates an explosive growth of USD $375 billion market capitalization by the year 2026. 

The idea of E-learning is being adopted and praised globally. The swift growth of the e-learning industry has opened many new opportunities for entrepreneurs to venture and create something that fills the industry gap. E-learning software (With add-on features) is one of them. Until now, the “e-learning software” was limited to provide video learning to the users. But the changing technology has brought additional opportunities too. 

**E-learning software development trends, 2021** 

The ongoing demand and continuous innovation have created ample space for new e-learning app development ideas. These ideas have grown from providing video lectures to providing personalized learning, influenced by Artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality.

**Mobile Learning**:-   For any necessary information, they furiously do a quick search on mobile. Hence, mobile users cannot be overlooked while making a learning management system. 

**Personalized Learning:-**  Personalized learning refers to the meaning of showing content made for the respected user only. The idea of Personalized content has always been used by social media giants to show exactly what a user wants. But its implementation in the e-learning sector is quite new.

**Micro-learning:-**  Apart from school and college-going students, the rest of the learners are busy, They have a short amount of time to learn new things. Hence, micro-learning was the only option to rescue 

**Big data in E-learning:-**  In the e-learning industry, big data plays a significant role in gaining necessary insights such as what a user wants to learn, what format he prefers, his total time spent on e-learning, and all the pain points of consumers that can be leveraged by providing utility filled e-learning software. 

**AI & ML in E-learning:-**  Now with the help of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the user can watch the content of his preferred choice and liking 

**Adaptive Learning:-**  Adaptive learning is a way to offer custom learning to the user with the help of fine-grained data, learning analytics, and analytics. Adaptive learning fulfills the unique needs of every individual.  You might get confused between Adaptive and personalized learning because both focus on the same things.  But be clear, as customized learning is about what you want, while adaptive learning is about what you need. 

**Virtual, Augmented, And Mixed-Reality Training, etc.** 

**Summing Up**

To make an idea successful, it takes years of continued research and implementation. E-Learning has also faced many hurdles in all these years, but this wonderful idea is now getting brilliant results. An **interactive e-learning software** with better implementation of all the above-listed technology trends can be the next leader of the industry.  If you need any help with [corporate e-learning solutions](https://www.tekkiwebsolutions.com/elearning-app-development/)**, visit this website today.

**Abstract**

Question and answer (Q&A) websites are a medium where people can communicate and help each other. Stack Overflow is one of the most popular Q&A websites about programming, where millions of developers seek help or provide valuable assistance. Activity on the Stack Overflow website is moderated by the user community, utilizing a voting system to promote high quality content. The website was created on 2008 and has accumulated a large amount of crowd wisdom about the software development industry. Here we analyse this data to examine trends in the grouping of technologies and their users into different subcommunities. In our work we analysed all questions, answers, votes and tags from Stack Overflow between 2008 and 2020. We generated a series of user-technology interaction graphs and applied community detection algorithms to identify the biggest user communities for each year, to examine which technologies those communities incorporate, how they are interconnected and how they evolve through time. The biggest and most persistent commu-nities were related to web development. In general, there is little movement between communities; users tend to either stay within the same community or not acquire any score at all. Community evolution reveals the popularity of different programming languages and frameworks on Stack Overflow over time. These findings give insight into the user community on Stack Overflow and reveal long-term trends on the software development industry.",4,5,2021-08-11 20:23:31,evolution of programmers communities on stack overflow,  corresponding paper      https   xb   abstract  question and answer  q a  websites are a medium where people can communicate and help each other  stack overflow is one of the most popular q a websites about programming  where millions of developers seek help or provide valuable assistance  activity on the stack overflow website is moderated by the user community  utilizing a voting system to promote high quality content  the website was created on  and has accumulated a large amount of crowd wisdom about the software development industry  here we analyse this data to examine trends in the grouping of technologies and their users into different subcommunities  in our work we analysed all questions  answers  votes and tags from stack overflow between  and   we generated a series of user technology interaction graphs and applied community detection algorithms to identify the biggest user communities for each year  to examine which technologies those communities incorporate  how they are interconnected and how they evolve through time  the biggest and most persistent commu nities were related to web development  in general  there is little movement between communities  users tend to either stay within the same community or not acquire any score at all  community evolution reveals the popularity of different programming languages and frameworks on stack overflow over time  these findings give insight into the user community on stack overflow and reveal long term trends on the software development industry

576,XtremeDevX,oyofve,[upcoming] Volt - A rust-based package manager that's up to 12x faster than Yarn,"Volt is a rapid,  lightweight, [open-source](https://github.com/voltpkg/volt), NodeJS package manager, written in Rust.

&#x200B;

It is upto 10x faster than Yarn and 11-12x faster than npm.

Volt took 2.12 seconds to add next as a dependency - a large library with a lot of dependencies. Yarn on the other, hand took 12.25 seconds on the same network connection.

&#x200B;

Volt uses a linking algorithm that ensures there is never more than 1 instance of the same version of a library on your machine, saving gigabytes of space in the long run.

&#x200B;

Why would you be interested in Volt?

&#x200B;

1. Massive Disk Space Savings
2. Rapid Package Installations
3. Lower CPU, RAM Usage
4. Significantly Lower Bandwidth Usage
5. Large Cost Savings

&#x200B;

When will Volt be released?

I've been working hard to add new features and make Volt robust. Right now, Volt is in a very early stage so it is not ready for use, however, the key mechanisms that make it faster and more efficient have already been put in place.

&#x200B;

580,Aviyelhq,ox53zm,What's the Relationship Between Innovation & Open Source?,"Here is what we have found: Open source framework adoption can increase the amount of innovation possible compared the proprietary, closed source code.

On a smaller scale, utilizing open source frameworks allows innovators to have more help with their projects, to be able to more swiftly fix problems in their code, to reduce the amount of unnecessary work that has been solved previously, and to increase overall efficiency in the creation of their products. These small scale improvements allow projects to be better for everyone.

On a larger scale, utilizing open source frameworks establishes an incentive for more people to participate in technology, teach other up-and-coming developers and to create thriving, symbiotic communities that are constantly changing and growing as technology grows. This increases the level of competition and quality of projects across the industry.

Suppose a non-technical client approaches me with an idea for the next revolutionary app (which happens to me on a monthly basis lol) - how can I best gather the specs? Should I involve the client in the UML diagram stage and ask him to write out detailed use cases? Or should the client make a simple wireframe?

Effective communication is key when working with a team.

I've never used UML diagrams but in my understanding they offer the following benefits:

1. The development team understands what needs to be built
2. Non-technical teammates understand how the app will function and can easily communicate their ideas via the UML diagram
3.

We are considering the hypothesis of developing an enterprise solution to be installed on the servers of our customers, who very often process sensitive data that for various reasons cannot be uploaded to the cloud.

&#x200B;

Obviously, having developed our product in Python places us several limits in terms of obfuscation and therefore we would like to find a clever solution that forces us to change our codebase as little as possible, but at the same time that can be run on different machines (therefore using for example containers, or VMs, etc.).

604,Ran4,oko5z4,Issue tracking based on chain of dependencies?,"So, when developing software, it's not uncommon that in order to finish a bigger task you need to split it up into smaller tasks, and the order that you tackle these smaller tasks is dependent on each other.

For example, you can't load test a feature unless you've first implemented a feature, and you (often) can't implement a feature without describing it (in a bit more detail).

But it seems like most software is based upon describing tasks either as trees (epic -> story -> task, where each epic typically contains many stories and each story contains multiple tasks) or just a list of ordered tasks.

I know that in Jira (and some other software) you can set a task as being ""blocked by"" another, but the general work flow isn't really built for that. Plus Jira is overly bloated.

I'm wondering if there's any issue tracking software out there that represents tasks as chains?

As in, instead of this (typical Jira-style):


               _____________Epic____
              /          ___/   \__ \____________
             /          /          \             \
          Story      Story          Story         Story
            |        /    \          |          /  |   \
           Task    Task     Task     Task       Task Task Task


You would represent it like this:


     _________________________________________________________________

(unless the project involves more than a dozen people, I personally prefer not separating into epic/story/task either, but instead just using tasks for everything - as people (including myself) can never manage to keep track of the difference between an epic, a story and a task).

The general idea would be that you hide away the not-yet-finished tasks so that you can focus on what's currently happening, so you don't clutter the board with dozens of things that will happen in the future but aren't really relevant right now.

You would also show it visually as the pyramid it really is.

613,smthamazing,og1qb4,How do you manage microservice database environments on developer machines?,"We are in the process of splitting our monolithic app into microservices. The main reason is that our clients (20-30 different companies) need different features, and it will be much easier to deploy only necessary parts instead of a huge configurable monolith.

Currently we use Docker, which allows developers to quickly get all services up and running. But there's an issue with databases.

Developers often need to restore data dumps from our clients on their local machines for debugging (note that staging servers do not cover this case, due to the need to quickly test experimental changes or migrations, etc). Doing this is relatively easy with a monolithic app, where you just download the dump and restore it in MySQL or PostgreSQL.

But with microservices each of them has its own database, so now you need to download and restore not just one, but 5, 7, or even more! Not only this is tedious, it is also error-prone: you can forget to update one of them and spend hours wondering about data mismatches or more subtle bugs.

How do you manage this? Is there a generally accepted solution for storing and applying a bunch of database dumps for different microservices? Or does everyone just come up with something ad-hoc, either doing everyithing manually or running custom scripts on Docker startup to download and restore DB dumps?

620,LaD-Cucho,odnrap,Should I change my framework? which one should i pick?,"Hi Everyone, I want to start by saying that i'm a real rookie in software development, knowing almost nothing, and to contextualize the doubt that i'll present, i'll just say that I've an engineering background (finishing Uni) and started as a gamedev hobbist learning how to use Unity. Trough my learning process I started into an idea where I could apply engineering into a specific kind of musical contests. 

I made some prototipes, went for some contests and got the well desired financiation (which is not much but i'm very happy to have it) to make it a real project, where i'll use the founds and also do my engineering's thesis.

I'm now at that moment of every project where you have so many roads ahead and you're not sure about which way to go cuz you realize how little you know. I could radically change the framework where i'm creating this software (Unity) or keep going with what i have.

**About the functionallities**, well, it's basically a metronome, so i need to have a precise time tracking system and be able to i.e. give parameters about ""song x has 80 bpm and the count starts at the 12th beat"" and being able to give to the user some feedback about it, which i think that every framework can do.

Unity is specially powerfull because, for one side, is easy to learn and i can very easily export to PC, IOS and Android, so i can use it in PC to make an overlay for contests (the main function that i seek, help with visuals in competitions) and with little effort also make training apps.

The problem of unity is that if i want to expand the app, permitting the user to record him/her self, Unity can access the cam and mic, but can't do a real time recording which would make this app soo cool.

So I am familiar with designing the schema of a relational database using PHP. I've hired a Ruby on Rails agency to make a web app. I've been asking them to provide me the schema design and run all changes to the schema by me. (The app has a lot of details that I can tell they don't have a strong grasp of and I want to make sure they're not relying on a schema that has errors in it/ needs to be changed as later specs get implemented). They have danced around my request for the past week and today ended up telling me to ""not worry"" because they use migrations and any mistakes made with one migration can I am assuming be fixed with another. This is not reassuring - at all. It also comes across as a red flag to me. I pointed out some incorrect attributes they had as part of an object and you would think that would teach them to reach out to me to verify what they have / proactively confirm any changes they want to make with the schema.. but they are very stubborn on not doing this.

What is the professional process for putting together a schema for a RoR app? Is this cowboy approach they've got going on actually accepted / the standard in the industry? If not, what process should they be following?

635,Jaruden,o6kkt1,Best option for mobile push notifications?,"I'm building a line of business app - not a consumer/marketing type app.  Based on various behaviors (user assigns task to another user, among other things), a user might need a notification that they have new tasks/messages/reminders/etc.

I'm running a .NET Core backend API in Azure already.  The client apps are presently pre-release and just iOS, but we may add Android support in the future.

Best options I've seen so far...

* Just do it myself.  Directly communicate with APN and whatever Google's is called.  Am I missing out on anything big or causing myself a lot of headache here?  It doesn't seem overly complicated.  Obviously I double the work needing to talk to both services.
* Azure Notification Hubs.  We're already using Azure, so this fits.  However, it seems like there's a lot of extras here we just don't need.  I'm not trying to market or track users based on this.  It also comes with pricing. Free for 500 devices, then $10/mo for 200,000.  This probably isn't a big deal if it saves a lot of time in various ways, but may be an eventual concern if we cross 200,000 devices.
* Firebase Cloud Messaging.  This seems designed to do a whole lot more and seems to want deeper integration into their platform (based on all the docs).  But it's listed as completely free.  We already use Firebase for some basic app distribution (mostly testing).  Is it really free for infinite devices & messages?  That seems surprising.  Can I avoid all the extra fluff and just get the notification on the device normally?
* AWS?  I expect they have something too, but we're not in their platform at all.  No reason to go there unless it's an overwhelming advantage.
* Something else?

The common screen lay out would first be an information category, which presents a grid of multiple rows of data on the left, then a set of tabs on the right, each with either forms and/or additional grids of rows. The objective is to set a URL which represents the category, the selected row on the left, the selected tab, and the selected field and/or row on the right.

We have looked at the HTML5 History API implementation as mechanism for setting and navigation between UI components, by appending a hash (#) value after the base URI which contains the information to select the proper subcomponents. The information would be element IDs with row IDs for grids, element IDs for tabs, and element IDs for form components. We would have delimiters for parsing to facilitate the drill down.

A URL would look something like this... [https://ourSPA.com/app#stand,parts=7,screws,types=2,quantity](https://ourspa.com/app#green,parts=7,screws,list=2,quantity)

648,cedricdb,nzlntf,University course on software development: what frameworks & languages?,"For years now, we have been teaching a software development course at our university in the 3rd year. It is a ""theoretical"" software development course, in which we cover:

* Exception handling
* Multithreading
* Serialization
* Networking (socket communication)
* Design patterns
* GUIs (JavaFX)
* Beans
* Reflection & introspection
* EDIT: also a bit on unit testing and JUnit

As you could have guessed, we use Java as our main programming language to introduce all these concepts. The students already know Python and C(++) and are generally quickly up to speed with Java. In the lab sessions, the students need to create a small software application from scratch and without any external libraries (apart from JavaFX). In this application, the student make a framework to chat and to play a game across the internet with an opponent.

Next year, we want to ""pimp"" our course a bit, but since we are all just university employees, we have little knowledge about real-world software development. It is \*not\* our goal to teach the students all kinds of modern frameworks that are currently used in industry. Like I said, it is \*not\* a practical course, but rather a theoretical one. We really want the student to create their little program from scratch, so that they have to program all eventing, multithreading, networking, etc. themselves. But we \*do\* want to follow general/large trends in industry. If Java is becoming less and less used to create desktop software applications, we are happy to switch to another language, for example.

What would your advise be for us? Are we still OK with teaching Java/JavaFX to introduce all these topics? Is desktop application development still the way to go, or should we shift focus to web-based applications? Or mobile development?

670,baincs,nn7tze,Architecture for a web app to add overlays to user's Youtube live stream video?,"Hi guys, I am trying to build a web app for users to easily add text (as open caption) and other assets in my app as overlays in real-time to their YouTube live stream video.

They will use their camera to record their video, and select from my app which text should be added to the video.

Then, the video will be sent to Youtube live through their API.

Here are my questions:

First of all, I was wondering if mixing video + subtitle and sending it to Youtube's rtmp url can be done from the client side, so it's simple and lightweight.

Second, should I encode the output being sent to Youtube? Can this be done from the browser too?

I'm only seeing a few node.js frameworks, and even they're not very mature (or is Webcodecs for this purpose?). Is a web app a poor choice for this task?

Lastly, if I do need a server to process the video, where should the encoding happen (from the user's machine, or in the server, or both?)? Is my server most likely going to be the bottleneck given YouTube's infrastructure, since video files are huge and my server is limited?

I am new to video streaming, so please excuse my lack of understanding of the subject. Also, if there's any good resource for my problem, please share them with me.

679,F4irline,nj8kst,Need opinion/guidance on architecture for a system,"Hey,

Me and a couple developers are going to be building a POC of a system in the next couple weeks, and I'm already trying to figure out the best way to build the actual system as soon as we're done with the POC and we've decided to move forward with it.

Rough explanation of the system: a root piece the system takes in data from a data source by listening to HTTP requests which the source sends whenever new data is available. The frequency could be hundreds of requests per second. The piece of our system then parses the data to find events that we're interested in. The ""events we're interested in"" will be defined through our front-end applications, which we have two of.

Both of the front-end applications are interested in same data events, but use them for a different purpose. Essentially the root piece of the system just parses and simplifies the data, and serves the simplified data to the front-end applications. It is essential that the data flow is very close to real-time (like 50ms delay between the root-piece and the front-end application is alright). The front-end applications display the data flow, manage the events the applications are interested in AND they are also used to configure the endpoints of the events.

The endpoints could be *for example* a device like a MIDI device or another HTTP server.

The root server of the system in the beginning only listens to one kind of data source, but in the future we might need to support some other data source, where the data might flow through websockets, UDP or the same way via HTTP POST requests, but the data model will be different. We most likely don't need to listen to multiple data sources at once.

These systems will run locally on a user's device, be it a Linux/PC/Mac. The systems would have some kind of a root system running in Cloud, where users can download updates to their locally running system and handle their licenses etc.

My initial thought of the architecture would be roughly this:

1. A Kotlin backend (maybe with Ktor or Spring Boot), which listens to the data source, parses it and sends events parsed from the data to any of the front-end applications
2. A NX Angular monorepo, which features those two front-end applications as separate apps within the monorepo, and separate NestJS back-ends for both which are used as a ""proxy"" and data storage for everything between the front-ends and the Kotlin backend
   1. On top of this, we'd have library/libraries in the same monorepo, to share components, datamodels etc.
3. Angular front-end and a Kotlin backend (also Ktor or Spring Boot) in the Cloud to handle the updates etc. to users' systems

Our team has been frustrated with the state of databases for years so we set out to create a database platform that:

* Is easy to manage and integrates seamlessly in your day to day workflow
* Can scale with you from idea to IPO

On the workflow side we've built live database branching, that lets you quickly get copies of your production db, and non-blocking schema changes, that let you push changes to your database like you push code updates.

This is all built on top of Vitess, which means you also don't have to worry about vacuuming, rebalancing, scaling, query planning, or downtime. Vitess is currently powering companies like YouTube, Github, and Slack, so you get the power of hyperscalers with any easy to use database platform.

Try it out and let us know what you think. We have a Developer focused plan that is free for forever and that you can get spun up in under 5 minutes.

694,Positive-Compote-526,nai9c0,Some thoughts on system design (For complex/growing systems),"These are my takes and some conclusions I came to from the short experience I have had so far.

Goals in design process

1. Clearly define the scope of the project
2. Aim for higher modularity - results in better extensibility
3. Do not sacrifice simplicity for modularity 

Questions to ask during the all processes (applicable for both high level and low level)

1. Are there two components that have similar functionality with very slight differences? E.g. two modules in code doing the same thing with one having extra argument(s).
   1. If yes - try to reduce them into one component (generalize).
      1. If the resulting system is too complex - problem on a higher level. The result is caused by incorrect approach to certain part(s) of the system. In this case review the direct higher abstraction. If everything seems fine it means there is a problem on a higher level; once you find the problematic level - fix it top down. If all higher levels seem fine then it might not be the optimal approach to the system; in this case - try redesigning.
   2. If no - the instance is well abstracted.
2. Are the systems communicating with each other? 
   1. If yes - do they depend on each other?
      1. If yes - try to remove the dependent relationship.
   2. If not - are they all needed?

I will try to post more on the topic if there is enough ""audience"" I guess.

I'm   a fairly novice engineer and my experience with attempting to build   microservices has been plagued with the following problems:

1. Request/Response   for service communication with a 'n' number of services has often led   to a huge ball of a system with n:n message connections.
2. Introducing   an event driven style meant adding a layer of indirection (message   queue, event log), complexity in logic in terms of aggregation and   sequencing, and the emergent behavior of the system becoming harder to   ""learn"" and understand.
3. A   gradual loss of abstraction as new business requirements often lead to   having to share/fetch state between services AND a gradual muddling of   initially defined service responsibilities.

Any advice would be appreciated but I do have more specific questions if that may help:

700,Hyphen_81,n8cg9t,Parsing Amazon Textract responses for various document layouts,"I have a question regarding parsing Amazon Textract responses.

I'm going to get a variety of invoices from many different companies. An invoice will typically always contain a table with a few pieces of information, like item description, quantity, unit price, and amount for each line item. However, these columns could be named in various different ways, and could be in any order.

My current idea is to have an array of words for each column that I want to identify, and just manage that array over time as I see new examples. When processing the response I would just search the JSON for each of the words in the array and identify it that way.

The downside to this is that I'd have to manage this array over time and obviously this seems brittle. 

Here are a few examples of invoice table columns to illustrate what I'm talking about:

Date, Description, Qty, Price, Total

Item, Service, Charges, Usage, Total

Services, qty, unit price, amount

746,jeremykovac,mkskiy,Is your product a vitamin or painkiller?,"Hey everyone,

Just wanted to share a challenging but honest update I think fellow builders should learn from. I've been working on gSweets for nearly a year now. Having done 20+ user interviews pre-launch we had a sense early on that the project was seen more as a vitamin than a painkiller – that is more of a nice-to-have than a must-have. We were ok with that at the time since we thought it was a fun project and that it could be a foot in the door to building more meaningful features on top of Google Docs.

Given that we were building on top of Google Docs, and that we had a high quality bar for the UX, it took us months to get the core feature ready, and then a few more months to build features on top of it like GIPHY, Unsplash and Emojis.

We launched on PH and within a couple of months had nearly 2K installs in the chrome webstore. We were soon nominated for a Golden Kitty Award for productivity. We were feeling pretty motivated and confident that things were heading in the right direction.

Unfortunately, felt we were missing 2 things, users emails and product analytics. We implemented product analytics and user accounts. We could finally communicate directly with our users and see how useful our product was to them.

After a few weeks of tracking, the data didn't lie. We had a very small group of users who would use gSweets a couple of times a week, but it was safe to say that overwhelmingly – users were not using gSweets. It was hard to accept given how much time was sunk into the project but we couldn't argue with the data. The biggest challenge was that although we have ideas on how to increase the value & frequency of usage, the platform risk of building on top of Google Docs was too high.

One of our teammates summed it up well. Normally you accept product risk OR technical risk. We had accepted both and it bit us in the ass.

We're still extremely motivated to continue improving the lives of the many PMs, Marketers and writers who've trusted us thus far. I just know that as we continue on this journey we're going to be try an follow these rules:

1. If you're not sure if it's a painkiller or a vitamin, launch in less than a month.
2. Either way launch with a paid plan to validate the pain.
3. Accept the technical risk for a painkiller that you've validated. Don't accept it if you know what you're building is really a vitamin.


That's it. If you have any questions feel free to drop a comment below.
I hope this is helpful to other builders out there.",3,18,2021-04-05 22:21:17,is your product a vitamin or painkiller ,hey everyone just wanted to share a challenging but honest update i think fellow builders should learn from  i ve been working on gsweets for nearly a year now  having done   user interviews pre launch we had a sense early on that the project was seen more as a vitamin than a painkiller   that is more of a nice to have than a must have  we were ok with that at the time since we thought it was a fun project and that it could be a foot in the door to building more meaningful features on top of google docs given that we were building on top of google docs  and that we had a high quality bar for the ux  it took us months to get the core feature ready  and then a few more months to build features on top of it like giphy  unsplash and emojis we launched on ph and within a couple of months had nearly k installs in the chrome webstore  we were soon nominated for a golden kitty award for productivity  we were feeling pretty motivated and confident that things were heading in the right direction unfortunately  felt we were missing  things  users emails and product analytics  we implemented product analytics and user accounts  we could finally communicate directly with our users and see how useful our product was to them after a few weeks of tracking  the data didn t lie  we had a very small group of users who would use gsweets a couple of times a week  but it was safe to say that overwhelmingly   users were not using gsweets  it was hard to accept given how much time was sunk into the project but we couldn t argue with the data  the biggest challenge was that although we have ideas on how to increase the value   frequency of usage  the platform risk of building on top of google docs was too high one of our teammates summed it up well  normally you accept product risk or technical risk  we had accepted both and it bit us in the ass we re still extremely motivated to continue improving the lives of the many pms  marketers and writers who ve trusted us thus far  i just know that as we continue on this journey we re going to be try an follow these rules   if you re not sure if it s a painkiller or a vitamin  launch in less than a month   either way launch with a paid plan to validate the pain   accept the technical risk for a painkiller that you ve validated  don t accept it if you know what you re building is really a vitamin that s it  if you have any questions feel free to drop a comment below i hope this is helpful to other builders out there

For my class project, we are working on developing a real estate appraiser app. We have all the functionality added except for a way to provide comparables.

&#x200B;

I've written an internal python package for my company to use, and I want to make sure the documentation is high-quality. Part of the package uses a config file (`yaml`). The config file can have many different options and structure.


I'm wondering if anyone has any great examples for how to document .yaml file structures so users can understand better how to formulate a valid yaml config for the given piece of software.

For example, if the yaml file is required to have a top-level `my_key` key:

    ---
    my_key:

How do I document this so the user knows `my_key` is required? Further, if `my_key` can take one of two valid options (e.g. `my_val_1` or `my_val_2`) , how do we document that so the user knows?

    ---
    my_key: my_val_1 | my_val_2

These are just examples, of course. I'm looking for a general guide on how to document such constraints.

So, quick backstory, 15 years ago I learned C just for the kicks of it. Massed around with it for a bit, tried learning C++ after but some issues never had me finishing that up. 

Now, I want to code a (very) basic software to stream with. Imagine it as a DeathCounter, but for shiny hunting in Pokémon.

Problem is, I don't know what language to code that in. I need a good GUI to capture and put on my stream, with a few images/GIFs put in a certain spot, a counter function and basically a few dropdown lists that help me chose certain functionnalities, like modify certain settings to change odds, stuff like that.

I did a quick software 2 years ago for a pen&paper game, which is just a basic GUI with cases to check so they light up and give a better idea of the result you gotta have with your dice. I did this in C# via Visual Studio, but it went kinda bad I'd say lmao

So, do you guys have any suggestions for me ?

777,nuno-filipe,m4bma0,Gathering requirements is an impossible task that leads to unsatisfied clients and half-baked solutions,"I have been dwelling on this question for a while and I would like to know your honest opinion.

Due to multitude of factors, that don’t matter much for the question at hand, my position in most of the jobs I had lately has been to be the link between the development team(s) and the « business / content ». An in between position, where I am knowledgeable about the business and the requirements of the client, but where I can also speak the language of developers and system architects. I am usually the guy that understands both worlds, allowing me to bring them together. I should stress that these businesses I am referring to are not connected to IT. They are just trying to take advantage of the most advanced technologies out there, and improve their way of functioning.

I like to think that this ability should be a great added value, but that has not been my experience lately. I think that there is something fundamentally flawed in the way requirements for software development are collected nowadays. If I can summarize it, it all comes down to being impossible to know and document in advance EVERY single requirement and the optimal behavior of the application. 

From my experience, also coming from someone that can and does code from time to time, there are issues that we only come across while actually coding. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the developers should NOT be agnostic to the content of what they are creating. And that we should start reducing the layers distancing developers and clients that we have erected in the past decade.

I have had many people counter arguing that the agile approach solves this problem, or that with good planing such problems do not occur. But that is not my experience at all. The agile approaches in practice are everything but agile. They just waste a lot of time of everyone and in the end no one is fully satisfied. On the other hand, it is simply impossible to collect requirements for every scenario possible. Even with the simplest of applications. Moreover, user stories are always super simplistic, not capturing the nuances of the costumers reality.

What I have come to conclude is that the only way of overcoming this problem is to have a VERY close and direct contact with the development team, on a daily basis. One should be available as much as possible to guide the team when questions arise. In addition, I find it very important that each developer has the autonomy to raise questions and proposed alternatives. Whenever possible, I also always try to explain how the thing that they are developing will be put in practice by the clients, and the positive impact that it will have on the business as a whole. 

To my knowledge there is no framework that envisages such way of working. I would like to hear your takes on this.",17,28,2021-03-13 20:03:21,gathering requirements is an impossible task that leads to unsatisfied clients and half baked solutions,i have been dwelling on this question for a while and i would like to know your honest opinion due to multitude of factors  that don t matter much for the question at hand  my position in most of the jobs i had lately has been to be the link between the development team s  and the   business   content    an in between position  where i am knowledgeable about the business and the requirements of the client  but where i can also speak the language of developers and system architects  i am usually the guy that understands both worlds  allowing me to bring them together  i should stress that these businesses i am referring to are not connected to it  they are just trying to take advantage of the most advanced technologies out there  and improve their way of functioning i like to think that this ability should be a great added value  but that has not been my experience lately  i think that there is something fundamentally flawed in the way requirements for software development are collected nowadays  if i can summarize it  it all comes down to being impossible to know and document in advance every single requirement and the optimal behavior of the application  from my experience  also coming from someone that can and does code from time to time  there are issues that we only come across while actually coding  therefore  i am of the opinion that the developers should not be agnostic to the content of what they are creating  and that we should start reducing the layers distancing developers and clients that we have erected in the past decade i have had many people counter arguing that the agile approach solves this problem  or that with good planing such problems do not occur  but that is not my experience at all  the agile approaches in practice are everything but agile  they just waste a lot of time of everyone and in the end no one is fully satisfied  on the other hand  it is simply impossible to collect requirements for every scenario possible  even with the simplest of applications  moreover  user stories are always super simplistic  not capturing the nuances of the costumers reality what i have come to conclude is that the only way of overcoming this problem is to have a very close and direct contact with the development team  on a daily basis  one should be available as much as possible to guide the team when questions arise  in addition  i find it very important that each developer has the autonomy to raise questions and proposed alternatives  whenever possible  i also always try to explain how the thing that they are developing will be put in practice by the clients  and the positive impact that it will have on the business as a whole  to my knowledge there is no framework that envisages such way of working  i would like to hear your takes on this

781,SnackyFace,m3fqkh,What can I learn and how can I work better with software developers as a layperson?,"tl;dr - Software people know how to software and insurance people know how to insurance, but no one seems to be able to bridge the language barrier between the two. What sources are available to learn, as a customer, about the software development side of a project provided by a contracted vendor so I can ensure we properly ask what we need and in a way they will understand? 

I'm an insurance professional working for a smaller organization. The organization is designed to be comprised of smaller insurance programs that utilize their own software, insurance products, etc. and they engage outside software developers to design the systems customized to their specific insurance program. This includes developing their insurance policy rating system, the system to actually make the final 100+ page insurance policy contract when someone buys a policy, and either a new client management system or extending an existing client management system to support the new program.

I've sat on a few calls between the software developers and insurance leaders, and it's extremely clear that both of them are speaking their own language while misunderstanding the other one. The developers know software and the leaders know insurance, so both of them are expecting things to ""just work"" but not trying to investigate any nuances that could complicate matters. 

I'm not a programmer but I'm probably one of the most technically-inclined people here that's not in IT. I've decoded/translated a few talks already but it's very clear I'm out of my element here. Requests are taking longer than expected, the project is behind schedule and going past budget from extra work, requests by leadership are being made and the resulting work isn't meeting expectations, and some fulfilled requests by leadership are so narrow-minded that it doesn't leave any room for future changes. It's almost like saying ""build me a system to do W, X, Y"" and the system comes back doing ""W, X, Y, "" but in a way that we can't do the related ""Z"" task later, even though Z would certainly be necessary based on what WXY was meant to do. 

What are some resources I could look at to try and get a better understanding of these projects? I originally looked at project management books but those seem to be more from the side of the developer and not the end-customer. I think this would have to do more with learning small elements of programming, mapping out ""tags"" in systems to determine what information input by an insurance professional actually translates to within the system, etc. I think my problem is that I don't even know where to start.

Any insight you can provide would be extremely appreciated.

I am looking for the right terminology to describe a GUI, which has modular components/containers (my words), which can be displayed or hidden, or moved around, docked or sized as required by the user.

In Visual Studio or Adobe Photoshop they call each of such ""containers"" a window. From my point of view a window isn't selfdescibing enough, because the whole app can be called a window in Microsoft speach. And if such application opens a new instance, it shows also a new window. And in microsoft foundation, even a button is called a window... You know what I mean... :-)

I am more thinking about calling it a ""widget"". But on the other hand ""widgets"" are commonly used for independent components. (if I think of widgets in mobile OS, Opera or Apple Dashboard)

The content of containers found in complex applications like Visual Studio or Photoshop are bound to each other. e.g.: if you select a file in an ""explorer window"", the ""content window"" is updated. And if you run the source code of the ""content window"", it's been shown in the ""console window"". So these ""widgets"" have dependancies to each other.

I am looking for a better terminology of such windows and also for the GUI/usage concept.

I graduated last year in the middle of this pandemic and was lucky enough to get hired to a QA team and now work in the front room of my house.

The Problem is I  find QA extremely dull and while I won't look a gift horse in the mouth, I wish to move to a development role and therefore need to learn how to develop in React.

My issue is I find it extremely tough to motivate myself after work to learn this language (done via udemy course) as I am usually tired and disinterested to concentrate more. There is the option of getting up earlier again, but I fear i won't be able to stick to that routine.

Hi there

I'm looking for some kind of stack, SDK, etc. that would help me bootstrap a project real quick.

That project is a backend system that allows for JSON content delivery to our custom applications (made with Unity). It will use .NET Core 5.

I need something that:

- Allows me to create custom models (""tables"" and ""columns"" if you will) with lots of column types and possibly create custom ones
- Have an interface to edit the content based on those custom models (if that interface is customizable, great!)
- Events logs of what content been edited, when, by who, etc. (At least, have to the tools so we can easily code that logging logic)
- Security: I need it to be customizable and flexible. We have this concept of ""project"" and the projects hold content and different users will have different access to different ""projects""

Is there anything out there that would fill those requirements ?

797,TheSmokeDiddler,lylmdp,Contractors milking us for every dime? Question on this,"Not a software developer - I work for a small company and for the past six months we’ve been paying four developers (2 on the app and 2 on our webpage) to add (what seem to me) to be very simple features.

Over the course of these six months, every single time anything is submitted it is riddled with bugs and must be fixed dozens of times and after six months of all this it still feels like we haven’t made much progress and things still aren’t really working smoothly for far too many users.

Now, some of these features do seem difficult - working with Siri to perform app functions, send texts through the app, etc.

But many of the issues/bug fixes are such simple stuff - like changing displays, numbers, words etc inside the app.  And yet still it takes months even for those minor fixes.

How common is it for third party contractors to milk a company like mine for all were worth so we have to keep paying them for months and months on end to fix things and get the features just right?

Obviously I wish we’d just fire them and get new ones but I think our owners logic is that since they started it they kinda are the only ones who can finish it since only the understand the code? Idk, not too sure

Based off my limited info above, would you guys say were likely being taken advantage of, or that software dev is just expensive and takes time? Or is it too hard to tell with the limited info?

801,blizkreeg,lxoyen,Why do all software project management tools suck?,"The short answer is probably because it's a people thing.

But, I feel like the tools themselves are lacking a basic understanding of the real problems in software development projects. They're all the same, whether it's JIRA, Linear, Clubhouse or any of the myriad other ones -- just with different UIs that are a better spreadsheet.

What are your biggest pet peeves and frustrations? Here are mine and I'm curious what others think.

1. Planning is hard. These tools throw a big backlog at you and grooming/planning is incredibly frustrating. They don't give me a good look into my team, their availabilities, or their capacity. It is also really hard to plan and estimate a sprint when you're just staring at a long list of tasks that are prioritized low/medium/high.

2. Once a sprint gets going, there are no guardrails, and no easy way to assess the ""health of a sprint"". Consider JIRA's Active Sprint view. If you have 6 people on your team, that's a freaking overwhelming board. You really have to hate your life to work with it. It takes way too many gymnastics to assess how we're doing, what's falling behind, and how much more we can actually get done. I'm surprised none of them have a ""resource view"". I have to filter person by person to get a better look into a team member's tasks. As an engineering or product manager, it's hugely frustrating to not be able to have a better lens into the current state.

3. No way for higher ups to get an insight into what's shipping and when. I've grown tired of answering the same question a hundred times - ""when is X going to be ready?"".

All of the above are based on my experience as a manager/lead, but it was no different as a developer.

Among the inordinate amount of other interests and projects I have, I’m wanting to make a bunch of “mini-apps” like customised calculators and organisational apps for my own personal use, and being able to operate them on my mobile device when my laptop is inaccessible would be a huge plus.

However, most apps seem to have to go through the App Store first, and as far as I’m aware, it’s a $100 fee per year for developers. Since I only have recreational interests, not commercial (though open to change), paying the fee isn’t very ideal for me.

Basically, I want to create my own apps to use “offline”, but I don’t know if there’s any other way to install them onto the mobile device.

I’m not very knowledgeable in software or programming yet, sadly, so I have yet to try any elaborate workarounds.

I just want to maximise my productivity through automated applications, but I keep getting the feeling that all the requirements to do so are getting more and more intensive, and the list of tasks longer and longer...

Why is nginx better than using the simple npm serve package? And if that serve package is worse than using nginx, how does nginx compare to using an express server to serve the static files?

I started leading a DevOps team in California that is closely working with our headquarters in Europe -> 9h difference.

We typically have meetings in the early AM with the Euros and then disconnect. Both teams work in the same department and on similar projects yet do not really collaborate on dev projects. I feel like the way we roll might be improved, hence wonder what other, large international companies do in order to use the time difference as benefit for collaboration.

sync with CA,

hand over,

continue in CA, ,

hand over to EU in the evening for the next day.

What do GGL / APPL / MSFT do to use timezones to their benefits? Are there any patterns for this?

Then, when I told them I wouldn’t be able to solve it over the phone they asked when they could expect it done by... As if I’m not already beholden to other deliverables. So, I told them I have major deliverables due this week and can’t promise any time towards what they want.

I answer with a stern “no,” and follow with, “I’m not even sure what you’re asking can be done with what we’re running.” I’m not BSing them either. I’m not front end and this isn’t really even front end. They’re basically just trying to embed some chart from one site in a company intranet page. Neither are developed by us, and it’s some weird widget thing with an input for html or something, I dunno. It doesn’t render correctly because of conflicting JS and style sheets, and it’s really not my problem or expertise area.

Anyway, then when they realized I wasn’t going to just drop everything and fix this weird thing, they threw me for another loop. They got the BI kid to roll some excel sheet to pretend it’s a database or something and asked if I could get excel to launch and load the sheet off a shared drive form a link in this same god forsaken intranet page. Wtf?

Now, probably could get something to work but, again, not on the phone and it’s not my wheelhouse. Then they insist I commit to it in two weeks... No! I told them I’m not in a place to commit time to anything that isn’t in my lane and that I’m honestly not sure this whole intranet thing will support it considering the problems with the chart (we do run Kanban and have a reasonably strict policy regarding how projects get prioritized and assigned). It would probably take longer than 2 weeks just to get support for this product on the horn and sort out the whole thing. 

Irony, this person is doing all of this to prioritize company projects... 

I dunno, how do you all deal with business units calling you direct and practically demanding dev work while they sit on the phone with you? We’re small and there is no good delineation between SRE, SWE, data engineering, IT ops and devops.

834,AnecD,lo41om,"Getting the Most Out of 20 Percent Innovation Time - perspectives from 3 engineering managers from Trustpilot, Improbable, and BCG Digital Ventures.","The 20% time has an almost mythical status. Popularized by Google, but with its roots actually stretching [back to the 1940s](https://www.fastcompany.com/1663137/how-3m-gave-everyone-days-off-and-created-an-innovation-dynamo), the basic concept is that 20 percent of an employee's paid time is dedicated to pursuing personal projects. The idea is that it creates a hotbed of innovation which might feed into company work and improve skills.

In software development terms, the products that have their foundations in 20 percent are legendary. [Google News, Gmail, AdSense](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/google-20-percent-time-policy-2015-4) — all allegedly came out of Google's own use of the concept, which it talked about in its [2004 founders' letter](https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/2004/): ""Google employees have '20 percent time' — effectively one day per week — in which they are free to pursue projects they are passionate about and think will benefit Google.""

In theory, it is a great way to stimulate innovation and creativity. Yet how effective is it in practice? It's a question that came up at an Indorse Engineering Leaders panel discussion, highlighting a concern that rather than using 20 percent of their time to focus on personal projects, developers actually end up doing their day-to-day work.

""It is not necessarily a bad thing if your developers are using their 20 percent innovation time to do day-to-day work,"" said Oswaldo Hernandez Perez, Engineering Manager at Improbable. ""It might be a signal for you and your leadership team that you may be putting the team under expectations of delivery that are not correct. Otherwise, why would they use that time to keep working on day-to-day work?""

Quite often, the first challenge can be getting a team to take the time. Once that is accomplished, it can then become an opportunity to see what they actually do with it and use those signals as an indicator of what's going on in the organization.

One of the other panelists, Sarah Vang Nohr, Engineering Manager at Trustpilot asked how managers can get developers that do not think they are creative to use the time effectively. ""We have different types of engineers, all the archetypes you could imagine. Some of them want to be creative, while others are more practical and matter-of-fact. It's a matter of engaging each team member and giving them the space to think outside of the box, and become comfortable being uncomfortable.""

Sarah's question highlighted a common issue within organizations, and how they perceive creativity as a whole (and not just in the context of development). While many consider it to be something intangible, innovation actually works best when working within defined structures. It's an approach Oswaldo takes with his teams — 20 percent projects are planned ahead of time, discussed in one to ones, and seen as much about personal skills development as they are about improving technical ability or innovating for the sake of it.

""We make sure that they get buy-in from product management, from UX, and they have to work on it with the view to shipping. This ultimately means that they're going to get to a point where they might have to convince other developers and others (e.g. designers, product managers) to give up their 20 percent time to commit to the project — it's an exercise in improving empathy and communication skills.""

That structure is critical to the success of the 20 percent time in an organization. Where many businesses go wrong is to automatically assume that if it worked for Google, it will work for them. They then implement it without considering what Google's problem was, and why innovation time was the solution. It is a classic example of solutioneering, where someone comes up with a solution, then has to find a problem it can solve.

What successful teams do is take the concept and see how they can structure it in such a way that it solves a problem for them — in the example above, improving personal leadership skills. By having the 20 percent projects involve other parts of the organization, developers get to learn critical soft skills that they might not get the chance to exercise when working on day-to-day work.

That was something Thomas Dittmer, Group Technology Director at Prestige Worldwide, really valued: ""As developers, we ultimately serve the business need, but there's often a disconnect between the way tech talks and the way business talks. Getting developers to think more laterally, to think beyond their immediate work, is critical to improving those relationships, and that's using 20 percent time as a true development tool, in all senses, is so valuable.""

To follow that point, Matthew Sinclair, VP at BCG Digital Ventures, also insisted that the 20% innovation time ""needs to be coordinated to be effective"" — and once it starts, it's a great way to get signals back from your team and all the engineers.

As Matthew summarized, ""The signal perspective is great. I'm a big believer in signals and I think one of the real superpowers of a good leader is the ability to know the right signals to look for.""

20 percent time clearly has benefits, if deployed in the right way. But its use, and abuse, are tied closely with how the organization in question approaches problem solving and creativity — it is when 20 percent time is expected to exist without guidance that it becomes a burden, rather than a source of innovation.

860,cs_legend_93,lc2tdi,"HOW-TO: Clone Folding Home?? Where to start, or how would you go about building a decentralized computational platform similar to Folding Home?","Hey all,

  
I have a business use case in which I will have both my API & a client (user facing) software application perform computational calculations like machine learning on analyzing files.  

I gave the example of 'Folding Home' because its something that everyone knows about and is familiar with.

**Use Case:**

I have trained a machine learning model to perform computational calculations on various audio files.  I am planning on making this available for clients to download as a local desktop application, or they can send their data to my server so that my server can 'crunch the numbers' for them.

**Assumptions:**

 I assume that the clients will mostly be on laptops, and computers that are not very strong in computational power, and will likely benefit in both speed and experience from another party performing 'calculations' on their behalf.  

&#x200B;

**Goals:**

Sure I can build out a massive cloud GPU computational platform, but I'd like to allow other users to participate and help crunch the number just like we see at these applications:

* [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/)
* [Golem](https://golem.network/home/) \- Global, Open Source, Decentralized super computer that anyone can access. It is made up from the combined power of users machines, from PC's to Data Centers.
* [Backend.ai](https://Backend.ai) \- A SaaS model which allows you to use their cloud GPU's to '**do work**' on your task.
* [ScyNet](https://scynet.ai/) ([github](https://github.com/comrade-coop/scynet)) -  Decentralized network for creating and training autonomous AI agents

  
I would like users to download a software that I create called ""**Become a worker**"" or something like that. And then they can 'join' and give their computational CPU & GPU power to the network, computing tasks and analyzing numbers which will take the load off the weak puny laptops of the users.

&#x200B;

**Difficulties:**

I am a very experienced C#, Java, GO, and least of all JavaScript (its to loosie goosey for my taste but I can work in it), I have no issue learning new languages and have worked in Python before. -  I see all these other codebases and companies doing what I would like to do, but I am just not sure where to start with this? I have tried to google tutorials and articles, but am left with dead-ends.  I have found  these open-source libraies that may or may not be helpful which I can use to create this:

* [Dipsy](https://dispy.org/) \-  Distributed and Parallel Computing with/for Python
* [A research document which outlines 5 libraries here.](http://openaccess.uoc.edu/webapps/o2/bitstream/10609/37061/6/mwundkeTFM0614paper.pdf) ([screenshot](https://ibb.co/RpzhH1H))

&#x200B;

**Questions:**

If you were me, or tasked with this - how would you build it? 

\-------------

I struggle to find example code. I suppose I can either:

* [Trudge and fight through learning Dipsy](https://dispy.org/)
   * I am not sure where to begin, the [documentation](https://dispy.org/) I am sure is fine, but I have no context for what I need to do, or how I should do it. Without seeing tutorials or full-blown [examples](https://dispy.org/examples.html) ([and here](https://pycos.org/tutorial.html)) I feel like I am shooting in the dark.
* [Fork and Clone Golem](https://golem.network/home/)

862,reymon359,lb4wuq,How to properly manage .env files in a microservices architecture,"Hi there! 

I have been working for some time on a project with a microservices architecture where each service has its own environment variables which are handled with a `.env` file for each service/repository. 

A great part of these variables are related to other services IPs and external resources keys which are different in each environment: Development, Staging, and Production so the `.env` is not a simple one.

Our development pace is fast and most of the time these variables change with new features and or changes implemented by teammates working on issues related to that service. This causes that almost every time others want to work with a service they get blocked and have to update the `.env` file before. Therefore we end up requesting and sharing `.env` files with each other all the time and there is a lack of a ""Source of truth"" for all the `.env` files.

I was wondering if someone else has had this problem or a similar one before and what approaches has followed to solve it or improve it. 

Is there any application or framework for sharing and managing `.env` files in a team in an automated way?

Thanks in advance!

EDIT

Just to be clear, these are not being added to source control and they are properly handled on CI/CD.

I was talking more about local development, setting up services locally, and keeping the `.env` local files up to date in an easy way.

879,ngochieu642,l4hlr3,"Create an Object to store Database records, is this a good approach","One of the seniors in my team raised that we should store database records in memory using code. His reason was that this would be more ""efficient"" than using database when we retrieve the record. I want to find out is this a good approach or not? 

We are using MariaDB, running on a raspberry using docker, request rate hardly > 1 per/sec

A record will be unique by N fields (prop1, prop2,...prop n). And we have to retrieve a record using queries like

SELECT d.id
FROM..
WHERE d.prop1 =..., d.prop2=...,...

The table which we run this query will likely to never exceed 1000 rows

My colleague said that: we will store data in the database but at the same time, create an object in memory so that we can retrieve the record ""faster"" 

I, personally, do not agree with this. 

Since I believe the search algorithm, as I do my research, using in database (B-tree) is very efficient and ensure a balanced tree structure. If we end up implementing that it's like re-inventing the wheel. Otherwise I could not imagine how are we going to achieve the same speed as the database 

Moreover, we will have to update the object, which is unnecessary complicated and time consuming. Not to mention that the object could become large, since we do not have a mechanism to manage its size, and cause memory corruption. It's like caching, but if we are mentioning cach, why not use Redis in the first place?

883,dunco__1,l37mtm,How to handle poor communication,"Hi r/softwaredevelopment

I am not totally sure this is the right sub to post in, so please let me know if you have any other recommendations.

I am looking for advice from devs and dev leaders on how to best handle a situation, and gather some clues as to why this may be happening.

I lead a small dev team of 5, in a mostly agile environment.

I have 1 team member who has superb technical skills, but is absolutely terrible at communication and collaboration.

An example is having a 13 point story in Jira that has finally been completed after being pushed to its 3rd sprint (we do 3-week sprints, so it's 6 weeks late). We have had regular 1:1s about this particular story, why it's important, what depends on it, etc. I have requested status updates, progress demos, and discussions on blockers many times throughout. I have also removed all other stories from this developer's sprint goals in order to ensure they are able to focus on completing it, with the exception of a couple of smaller maintenance tasks so that she has a balance of challenging and ""quick-win"" work.

At the end of the sprint, I was advised of a blocker: a minor portion of our current architecture needs to be refactored to allow this story to be implemented. This did not come up during our sizing or sprint planning sessions - was a total unknown that surfaced after diving deeper.

I am now certain the story should have been sliced, as 13 points were clearly insufficient. I am absolutely fine with there being an unexpected blocker; there is no problem at all in adjusting the story, collaborating as a team on resolving the blocker, etc. However, issues like this example (note, it's one of many), are consistently causing the team to fail to meet our goals, and causing other team members to fall behind while they wait on her work to be completed. It's also starting to cause issues with our stakeholders and users, as features are being shipped much later than estimated, where I am only able to give them last minute negative news that their feature will not be included in the release. I feel this is reflecting poorly on me, as I should know about any issues much earlier, and be supporting in getting them resolved.

It seems very unlikely to me that this blocker would have come up at the end, unless work wasn't started on it until the last minute. Which is a problem in itself given it was already pushed twice. I have had my senior dev comment that this team member is a perfectionist and likes to work autonomously to solve issues without asking for help. This is in friction with our team culture and agreement, and is clearly having knock-on impacts.

For this software I need to input information such as weighted errors or  compliance from multiple operating rooms and multiple surgeries and it  produce metrics and reporting (pareto, temperature charts, bar graphs  etc.) based on the rules I set, then feed into a dashboard that can show  me multiple hospitals I am engaged with and the rating of that  facility.

For example:

ABC Hospital Operating room #1

A surgical item was missing: 3x (light weight error)

An item broke during surgery 1x (heavy weight error)

CBA Hospital Operating room #1

A gown was missing from the room: 4x (very light weight error)

A non sterile item was used on a patient: 1x (very heavy weight error)

Now  if the hospital on the dashboard is yellow or red, I am need to click  on this facility, see all the entries by way of pareto, temp chart etc.  to identify root cause.

891,UnrelatedConnexion,kzpnpy,"""Real"" REST APIs?","The other day I was re-reading a summary of the REST thesis of Roy Flemming and some of the constraints he exposed [here](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven). And I was wondering, how many of you actually create ""real"" REST APIs?

Especially this bit: 

>A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might use the API). From that point on, all application state transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided choices that are present in the received representations or implied by the user’s manipulation of those representations. The transitions may be determined (or limited by) the client’s knowledge of media types and resource communication mechanisms, both of which may be improved on-the-fly (e.g., code-on-demand). *\[Failure here implies that out-of-band information is driving interaction instead of hypertext.\]*

I can see the advantage of using hypertext for decoupling the client and server, especially by avoiding the creation of URLs on the client-side. But I must be honest, I never did that and except for very few examples here and there I have yet to encounter APIs offering this.

So I was wondering, how many among my fellow software developers have implemented REST properly?",11,11,2021-01-18 09:12:48,real rest apis ,the other day i was re reading a summary of the rest thesis of roy flemming and some of the constraints he exposed  here  http especially this bit   a rest api should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial uri  bookmark  and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience  i e   expected to be understood by any client that might use the api   from that point on  all application state transitions must be driven by client selection of server provided choices that are present in the received representations or implied by the user s manipulation of those representations  the transitions may be determined  or limited by  the client s knowledge of media types and resource communication mechanisms  both of which may be improved on the fly  e g   code on demand      failure here implies that out of band information is driving interaction instead of hypertext    i can see the advantage of using hypertext for decoupling the client and server  especially by avoiding the creation of urls on the client side  but i must be honest  i never did that and except for very few examples here and there i have yet to encounter apis offering this so i was wondering  how many among my fellow software developers have implemented rest properly 
892,goldDichWeg,kz3va4,"As a team leader, how do you deal with difficult product owners?","I try to keep it short: I have a product owner that oversteps his boundaries the role itself should give him. What I mean is that he constantly tries to discuss technical details where he has absolutely no idea about, and therefore makes decisions that are based on 0 IT-knowledge.

I am talking about a person that even want to discuss what programming language we should use, based on his five minutes research (quote: 'I think we should use Swift for our web application because Apple is a company I trust'; yes, that's what he said).

The problem is that my product owner is also the CEO of the company. Our project is doing really badly because I couldn't convince him to change his priorities.

Things that are 'problematic' right now that is founded on his decisions:

*  a sprint is as short as one feature, he doesn't believe in the normal type of sprints and wants to review every thing we do as fast as possible
* every week, he has around 10 to 20 new ideas with questionable quality that he want to be implemented ASAP. Problem is that these ideas are very detailed already and therefore prevent us from having a useful progress in our software (e.g.: wording of titles, size of texts, multiple options of dialog navigation etc.)
* he always sets the least useful, more detailed features as high priority and demands from us that we focus on these features, even though everyone around him tries to tell him that this is a very bad idea.
* one of the problems that are not as significant as the others, but still annoying: he always has 'cool' ideas. Like, ideas that seem to be super 'different' but at the end are just dumb, confusing or just plain bad.

When I create a new project, I share it here on reddit, have some interesting feedbacks sometimes, and after few days project issue tracker activity switch to idle mode.

Few times a year I have a bug raised on one of the project and that's all.

**How do you proceed to identify which of your projects people rely on, what can one do to engage with its users audience ?**",8,14,2021-01-08 19:30:03,how to have an estimation of number of people using actively your projects  ,i have many small repositories on  my github  https yet i have no idea which one of these projects i can consider the most successful  no idea how many active users i have and if one of this project is important for some people when i create a new project  i share it here on reddit  have some interesting feedbacks sometimes  and after few days project issue tracker activity switch to idle mode few times a year i have a bug raised on one of the project and that s all   how do you proceed to identify which of your projects people rely on  what can one do to engage with its users audience
