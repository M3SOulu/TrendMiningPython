Numerical algorithms approximate intractable quantities from computable ones. They estimate integrals from evaluations of the integrand, or the path of a dynamical system described by differential equations from evaluations of the vector field. In other words, they infer a latent quantity from data. This book shows that it is thus formally possible to think of computational routines as learning machines, and to use the notion of Bayesian inference to build more flexible, efficient, or customised algorithms for computation. The text caters for Masters' and PhD students, as well as postgraduate researchers in artificial intelligence, computer science, statistics, and applied mathematics. Extensive background material is provided along with a wealth of figures, worked examples, and exercises (with solutions) to develop intuition.

These models are then either frozen and used directly for other tasks (zero-shot/few-shot), or additionally trained on other tasks (fine-tuning).

But for real-world applications, it's also very meaningful to search for failure cases preemptively to fix the underlying issues. Can you find and convincingly demonstrate these failure cases where zero-shot/few-shot performance of language models scales *inversely*, with larger models behaving worse?

9,9,ben_cow,vmv54i,[D] [P] Questions about the usability of Shapley values on large feature spaces.," 

Hello! I am planning a research project which involves creating a classification DNN that takes in a frame from a molecular dynamics simulation of a protein which encodes each amino acid's  level of energetic interaction and tries to predict whether that frame came from protein state ""A"" or protein state ""B.""  I want to analyze the feature importance, that is, the importance of amino acid's energetic interaction level for making the classification prediction. Although I have heard some interesting applications with Shapley values to preform such an analysis on feature importance, the input layer structure of the model I am thinking of making would require 100+ neurons as there are 100+ features. The reason why the feature space is so large is because I am investigating how a model learns which amino acids are most important for the model to make a classification prediction for which state a protein is in where the protein is 100+ amino acids in length. Can Shapley methods handle a feature space of a model that large /would the computational cost of such a process be infeasible? Apologies if this question is a little unclear let me know if anything needs to be clarified.

So I worked out the eigenvectors of the Laplacian of a path graph (a line of vertices connected by edges like so: v-v-v-...-v), which is the kind of graph used in NLP to represent a sequence of tokens, and found that the ith eigenvector's kth entry is v\_i(k) = cos(πik/n − πi/2n) where n is the number of tokens in the sequence, which is very different from the sinusoidal PEs used in transformers in NLP.

11,11,moschles,vmdl3l,[D] Surface rendering in Diffusion Probability Text-to-Image Generators.,"Two diffusion text-to-image generators are Google's Imagen and openai's DALLE.2.     

DALLE.2 uses a multimodal large language model called CLIP to encode an input text prompt.  The output is produced by a reverse encoder called a diffusion probability model.   Diffusion models have previously seen huge successes in *image super resolution* and denoising.  

One peculiar aspect of DALLE.2's  output is that it is capable of generating light sources in certain (seemingly) 3D locations in the scene, then correctly lighting the objects based off of their implied location.   DALLE.2 can also perform image completions from a starting image prompt.     The two examples below are Spongebob dish sponge in a sink, and Vermeer's famous earring painting.    


https://i.imgur.com/vVI6IOI.png

.


https://i.imgur.com/8h48lTg.png

.

One plausible explanation for these physically perfect surface reflections is that DALLE.2  performs a phase where the image is reverse-encoded into a 3D scene.  That scene is then rendered back into a 2D output image.    However, when consulting the primary literature, no such conversion to a 3D model is seen anywhere along the DALLE.2 workflow.  

The implication is that DALLE.2 must contain a wealth of priors related to light transport, gleaned simply from 2D training images alone.  This means these priors are being applied (mostly correctly) to particular instantiations of objects and surfaces in scenes.  This application is performed even to the point where wet metallic surfaces have correct blurring in reflections.       

Further investigations of this phenomenon would involve finding some user prompts that generated a scene containing light casting a sharp shadow onto a flat surface.  Another would be requesting a reflective object in the text prompt itself.

I'm the creator of dstack, a tool that makes it easier to train models in the cloud. Our tool allows extending it with custom providers to support different languages, frameworks, etc.  
All the built-in providers are also open-source. Today, we've released a new update that extends the capabilities of dstack beyond training models, and now also allows users to quickly build and share apps with Streamlit, Gradio, and FastAPI in the cloud – in just a few clicks.  
Similar to apps, it's possible to run dev environments with required hardware and data access also in one command from the Terminal. All you have to do is to link your own AWS account to run commands.

Minecraft is one of the harder challenges any RL agent could face. Episodes are long, and the world is procedurally generated, complex, and huge. Further, the action space is a keyboard and a mouse, which has to be operated only given the game's video input. OpenAI tackles this challenge using Video PreTraining, leveraging a small set of contractor data in order to pseudo-label a giant corpus of scraped footage of gameplay. The pre-trained model is highly capable in basic game mechanics and can be fine-tuned much better than a blank slate model. This is the first Minecraft agent that achieves the elusive goal of crafting a diamond pickaxe all by itself.

Updated with more context:

The typical usage of skip gram is for learning word embedding as in text where each word has an embedding which is learned through skipgram. However there is nothing limiting the usage of skipgram for non-text cases.

A popular way to use skipgram in i2i recommendation systems is to treat a session of products browsed by the user as a sequence and to have an embedding per product. (Eg see KDD 2018 winning paper from Airbnb) However, the question I have here is instead of having one embedding per product can we instead use a neural network where the output layer is the embedding layer.

We participated in IEEE SP Cup 2022, sacrificing nearly 2 months of our time and and some sleepless nights. The organizers never said anything about keeping the leaderboard of the competition hidden. In the first round they gave us an access to a website where we can submit our predictions and get our score privately.

After the first round, we and several other teams requested the leaderboard.

The funny thing is, there was no such option for students to create a poll in piazza 😂. Even though we mentioned it to the organizers, we didn't get any reply. Now it has been almost a month since the competition concluded and the organizers totally ghosted us.

42,42,OddSandwich969,vl45a2,[Discussion] Doubt regarding text vector difference image manipulation method of Dalle-2.,"I was going through the (updated)paper, there was this image manipulation method through text difference.
It went like this:

z_i := original image CLIP embedding

z_t := new text CLIP embedding/ embedding of the text for current image manipulation

z_t0 := orignal image's corresponding text CLIP embedding/ text embedding of the text 'a photo' / empty embedding

z_d := l2_norm(z_t - z_t0) <-> text difference vector | 
Here l2_norm means, normalising a vector by dividing it with it's norm_p (here norm 2).

z_new /z_theta :=  spherical_interpolation(z_i, z_d, theta) {where theta is between (0,0.5)} <-> new image's CLIP embedding vector 


What I don't understand is, that the CLIP img and text embedding vectors are supposed to be similar vectors (since trained with cosine similarity), and the difference between text embedding vectors of two similar texts will be somewhat perpendicular to either of the text vectors, therefore the text diff vector should be very different from the image embedding, and hence the spherical interpolation shouldn't give any meaningful result.

To summarize, many people are interested. Opinions are in common that:

1. People like private review rather than public review
2. Number of papers to review are not a concern but every couple months will be a good pace
3. Plagiarism and stealing are of course the biggest concern

To address this, I suggest the following mode:

1. ONLY opens for people who want to exchange paper reviews. Enthusiastic reviewers with no paper draft to be reviewed can wait.
2. ONLY opens for people who are really interested in mocking paper review prior to formal journal/conference submission. Join a Discord community (already established).
3. In the PRIVATE ""Introduce yourself"" channel, people introduce themselves using true information and offer a very brief paper abstract and ML category.
4. Chat openly or privately to find the right review partners
5. In the ""paper-review-exchange"" channel, announce your paper reviewer upon agreement (from both sides)
6. Exchange your drafts privately and preferably with official email addresses
7. (Optional) When the review work is done, announce it too.
8. Note that plagiarism and stealing can be minimized in this mode but still could happen.

1. if a feature doesn't lie on the path then that feature's attribution for that path would be zero.
2. if feature lies on the path and also lies on the path of Xf then it's attribution is positive.
3. if feature lies on the path but doesn't lie on the path covered by Xf then attribution is negative.

But I can't get my head around the quantification of these contributions - especially the weighting.i.e., **POS = W(|Sp|-1, |Np|)\*v** ;

46,46,anvinhnd,vl65tk,[R] [D] How can one rigorously and efficiently deal with binary classification problems on multi-label data?,"To be clearer, I'd like to start learning about some techniques or the literature about this particular type of binary classification problems. Please share if you happen to know about this (keywords, links, articles, etc are all appreciated).

So, the problem is supervised binary classification. In general, there is nothing special about the dataset apart from the fact that the train/val data from one of the 2 label classes (from now on, let's say it's negative) are already further labeled into multiple subclasses. From there, the problem has an additional goal (other than binary classification): to maximize the number of subclasses that are classified well by the model. By ""classified well"", I mean that, for example, if one restricts the negative side of the dataset into one of such subclasses, the performance of the model is higher than some close-to-perfect thresholds.

47,47,MurlocXYZ,vkp3y2,[D] Is it time to retire the FID?,"I know the main metric used to measure the quality of generative models is the FID. However, it seems to me that some problems arise when evaluating a generative model using another model. A couple that come to mind:
- Inception v3 itself is 7 years old at this point. Nowadays, we have models with much higher ImageNet classification accuracy, which presumably translates to better internal representations. Why are we still using Inception v3 instead of, for instance, ViT or some more recent model. 

- The ImageNet dataset that is commonly used to pretrain the Inceptionv3, while being quite comprehensive, is still limited to 1000 classes. If I want to train a model to generate classes that are semantically distant from ImageNet classes, what guarantees do I have that the activations of Inceptionv3 will be meaningful? This is more so problematic with models like DALL-E, which are trained on much larger datasets and can generate from the open set, essentially.

Perhaps I am misinterpreting things, but it seems to me that the FID is a case of ""good enough"" that sort of stuck around.

51,51,yapoinder,vklemr,Is there any way of using a text editor with Kaggle or Google Colab notebooks? [Discussion],"UPDATE: SOLVED

The lovely people in the comments guided me to a better method of using github and cloning my repository in the kaggle runtime using the !git clone command. I was unaware you could clone a github repository and run a python file in this method. I was even able to create an anaconda environment and run everything smoothly. So everything is running smoothly again :D <3 <3 :D

&#x200B;

\-------------

I am training a video classification neural network which involves opencv based image augmentation and then after the training completes I run a series of test with my test datasets.

so with all of the functionality the code base is close to 6k lines of code.

This is really hard to work with in the current notebook cell format, if I want to make any changes I have to scroll a lot and often I get confused since my python Classes are thousands of lines each with many functions built in.

Using an editor like VSCODE is 10000x times easier than working with notebooks.

Has anyone figured this one out?

Yes I realize I can work in VSCODE on my local computer and then manually transfer the code to kaggle, but this is incredibly tedious when making small changes to file paths and general code changes.

Im shocked there isnt a better way around this !!! I mean c'mon how do we expect AI to be adopted by the masses if we cant have a streamlined way of developing software?

The MOT model used is SOTA, and each tracklet is accurate enough; but given long videos, long occlusions and out-of-frame movement still often result in the same person getting spread out across multiple separate tracklets.

Clearly I'd like to find a way to merge tracklets that actually correspond to the same person. In other words, a re-id problem.

However, 99% of the re-id literature seems to be mainly concerned with multi-camera re-id. (Probably driven by 1984-esque surveillance camera wet dreams, but that's a different topic.)

What is the SOTA for unsupervised (or online self-supervised) single camera re-id, preferably utilizing whole per tracklet latent space?

- Conference on Causal Learning and Reasoning (CLeaR): https://www.cclear.cc/
- Conference on Lifelong Learning Agents (CoLLAs): https://lifelong-ml.cc/

Some of these conferences are quite new and grew out of different workshops. Many of them are trying to establish themselves as top venues in their niche fields. Here, I would like to get some opinions from the ML folks. Could folks comment on these conferences, e.g., based on different dimensions?
- **Prestige**: Are these conferences perceived to be as pretigious as the top ML conferences? 
- **Usefulness**: Does hiring committee in the academia and industry treat these conferences the same as top ML conferences? If not, how much will the nich conferences be discounted? (Closely tied to prestige, though)
- **Dissemination**: Are papers at these niche conferences much less visible to researchers outside the subfields? (This seems important to me because research nowadays often leverages ideas from different fields.)
- **Difficulty**: Is it easier to get papers accepted at these conferences as compared to top ML coneferences?
- **Networking**: Is there really more opportunity to get to know folks working in the same subfields at these conferences (given that it is much smaller)?

- I have published several papers in the top ML conferences listed above, and am considering whether to try out niche ML conferences. Personally, this feels like a ""bet"" for me on whether the niche conference will be successful in the future.

However, since most of user traffic goes to control arm, only a fraction of it goes to experiment and thus the feedback loop doesnt close unless we have 50-50% experiment (that we can't).

64,64,ffast-math,vj7nf5,"[P] Farewell, CUDA OOM: Automatic Gradient Accumulation","Hey everyone,

If you've trained a lot of neural nets, you probably know the pain of getting CUDA OOM errors and iteratively tuning your batch size to avoid them.

Which is why I'm excited to announce that we (MosaicML) just released an automatic way to avoid these errors. Namely, we just added [automatic gradient accumulation](https://docs.mosaicml.com/en/latest/notes/auto_grad_accum.html) to [Composer](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer), our open source library for faster + easier neural net training.

If you're not familiar with gradient accumulation, it's like tuning the batch size, but without messing with the optimization (aside from slightly different BatchNorm stats). This lets you avoid tuning learning rate, weight decay, etc based on how much memory your GPU has or how many GPUs you're training on.

What's nice about the \*automatic\* gradient accumulation in Composer is that you just set the batch size and hparams once and you're done—no need to tune the gradient accumulation manually.

67,67,japanhue,vjn9jv,"[R] Unpublished physics inspired ML paper from 2021 (Yang-Mills theory, differential geometry, gauge theory)","Hi there,

The purpose of this post is to share a [research paper/notebook](https://lukepereira.github.io/notebooks/documents/2021-moduli-attention/main.pdf) I wrote that has been mostly unread and unnoticed by others, and also to ask how to find research collaborators without participating in academia or industry.

After I finished my BSc, I was deeply interested in geometric deep learning and wrote this paper \[0\] describing an attention mechanism using ideas from differential geometry and gauge theory commonly used in the standard model (via Yang-Mills theory). At the time, I sent the notebook/paper to every researcher in the geometric DL area that I was aware of but didn't get any replies or interest in collaboration. Without any openings and at the peak of a pandemic, I sadly had to drop the idea and get a standard software engineer job.

Since then, I've seen much of the rough ideas explored and developed independently by others. For example, M. Bronstein and his collaborators have similar applications of using connections (equivalent to sheafs) and Ricci flow in Graph NNs \[1\]. I have more ideas that I would like to explore, but feel destined to be an outsider in this field with my work unnoticed or considered illegitimate. Is it possible for people like me to collaborate with other researchers outside of academic institutions or industry? Does anyone know of such an organization?

Thanks

But just feeding 26 K dimensions to a neural net seems lazy, but if I reduce it to say 768 dimensions, I've basically carried out the whole embedding task before I pass it to the neural net, which limits the improvements it can make.

An idea I have: If we believe the model should first learn existence of blobs then learn the order (a fair assumption in my application), we could first find a matching between all generated blobs and target blobs and optimize the best matches only, then impose a penalty to get the order right.

However, benchmarking them can be complicated, mainly because most implementations stay just as research code to reproduce the experiments in the papers. Moreover, when dealing with tabular data, you need to handle continuous/discrete/categorical data correctly -- not just let some regressor approximate everything.

HyperImpute is a library that should make it easy to benchmark new imputation algorithms while offering several state-of-the-art models. For example, imputing using MIWAE can be done as easy as this:

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from hyperimpute.plugins.imputers import Imputers
    
    X = pd.DataFrame([[1, 1, 1, 1], [4, 5, np.nan, np.nan], [3, 3, 9, 9], [2, 2, 2, 2]])
    
    plugin = Imputers().get(""miwae"")
    out = plugin.fit_transform(X.copy())
    
    out

Bonus, it can be easily plugged into sklearn pipelines.

82,82,guyfrom7up,vj1zp0,[P] AutoRegistry: A Python library for mapping names to functionality to simplify project configurations.,"A common design pattern I see in a lot of ML projects is to have some sort of experiment configuration file, and then a bunch of code that constructs the appropriate objects based on these configurations. Frequently, the resulting code blocks have a bunch of `if/elif/else` statements, or a manually created lookup dictionary somewhere. This can quickly get messy and inconsistent as you add new models/losses/encoders/optimizers.  

AutoRegistry is a library that makes all of these lookups more organized and terse. For example, lets say you want to configure a backbone to either be ""resnet34"" or ""resnet50"". Your code could look something like this (mimicking torchvision code) using a decorator: 

```
from autoregistry import Registry

models = Registry()

@models
def resnet34(*, weights: Optional[ResNet34_Weights] = None, progress: bool = True, **kwargs: Any) -> ResNet:
    return _resnet(BasicBlock, [3, 4, 6, 3], weights, progress, **kwargs)

@models
def resnet50(*, weights: Optional[ResNet50_Weights] = None, progress: bool = True, **kwargs: Any) -> ResNet:
    return _resnet(Bottleneck, [3, 4, 6, 3], weights, progress, **kwargs)

# create a model based off of some configuration dictionary.
model_config = copy(config[""model""])
model_type = model_config.pop(""type"")
model = models[model_type](**model_config)
```

or, class-based inheritance (uses metaclasses internally):

```
class BaseModel(nn.Module, Registry):
    pass

class MyNewModel(BaseModel):
    pass

class SomeOtherModel(BaseModel):
    pass

# stringified keys are automatically derived.
my_new_model = BaseModel[""mynewmodel""](**config)
some_other_model = BaseModel[""someothermodel""](**config)
```

Hey everyone -

I've been working to reproduce [CheXNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05225.pdf) \- a fantastic paper describing research on a model capable of radiologist-grade pathology classification!

CheXNet uses Class Activation Mappings (CAMs for short) to generate heatmaps that identify what parts of the image the model uses to base its classification. In my case, I'm facing a bit of a struggle reproducing them - as shown in the image below, **most of our classifications are derived from the diaphragm, instead of regions within the lung**. Curiously, we are attaining a reasonable AUROC, with .773 on training and .749 on validation data - the paper reports .8062 AUROC.

My current model is being trained on a subsample of the main dataset, and I'm basically looking to this as a way to validate the architecture. I'd love to know if anyone has experienced similar issues and solved them, and could have any input here as well.

If you have a moment to spare - I'd be super grateful for some help from the r/MachineLearning community in solving the inaccurate localization issue - [\#58](https://dagshub.com/nirbarazida/Pneumonia-Classification/issues/58)!

We are happy to announce the release of DAMP 2.0 \[a\]. DAMP (Discord Aware Matrix Profile) is an anomaly detection framework that allows you to search datasets with millions or billions of datapoints, all on a conventional machine \[b\].

We are not normally so vainglorious as to announce the publication of  a paper, however:

1)  The code comes bundled with some great new anomaly detection datasets, and there is a real dearth of good datasets in the community (see \[c\])

2)  Some researchers are working on problems that use anomaly detection as a subroutine, and that is their main computational bottleneck. Because DAMP can be up to 10,000 times faster than other approaches, this may be of interest to the community

How do I interpret this? The noisier data will also go in the test split, and the model is expected to perform worse on those, so even if it's exactly as good as the prior model on the old data, it should have an average worse performance on the new dataset. It could even be better, say scoring 91% on the old data, but 85% on the new data, so the average accuracy looks lower even though you have a better model.

109,109,MLJungle,vhzk9e,"[D] Iterative ""imputation"" HMM sequence generation idea","I have an idea in my head that I am looking to get some feedback/formal understanding of.

Say we consider a n-gram model (ex: bi/trigram). For sequence generation (such as a sequence of words),  one way would be to start with some input word and then use the n-gram model to simply unroll and predict the rest of the words, generating some sentence. If O is original and N is new, we would have O-N-N-N-N.. and so on.

Alternatively, I was thinking of a way to generate a sequence that might be more similar to the original text but still be stochastically generated. One use case for this would be generating sequential synthetic data, where the synthetic data should be as similar to the original data but should be generated and have a stochastic nature to it.

Here, let us take some sequence and proceed to do imputation- we nullify every other word, starting from the first input word. Then, we use a trained modified 'sandwich' HMM bi-gram model which predicts based on the before and after word. Then, we use the sandwich HMM to fill in the nullified every other word. Now, our sequence would be O-N-O-N-O. To get a more fully generated sequence, we could use another model, a trained bi-gram HMM model to impute the original words- in particular, for the third word it would use O-N to generate a guess, for the fifth it would use the next O-N, and so on, giving us ONNNN..., where each guess utilizes both O and N.

My idea is by doing this ""imputation"" step wise to generate our words, rather than unrolling it out all at once, is that we have remnants of the original text in conjunction with new predicted words to guide the generation of each word as opposed to possibly just new predicted words with the unrolled method.  This may lead to more similar generated sentences.

(A more extreme method might consider just using the original data to make every prediction- for example, we could consider a trained bi-gram model that uses the first word O to predict the second, the second O to predict the third, and so on. I don't think this will lead to good generated sequences we would have O-N-N but the third word does not depend at all directly on info from the second.)

Streaming SQL is the key user interface. We recently worked out a solution to apply ML/prediction in the Streaming SQL, so that you can continuously train and predict data when new data comes.

**(SMM4H Shared Task  at COLING2022)** 

[https://temu.bsc.es/socialdisner/](https://temu.bsc.es/socialdisner/) 

Despite the high impact & practical relevance of detecting diseases automatically from social media for a diversity of applications, few manually annotated corpora generated by healthcare practitioners to train/evaluate advanced entity recognition tools are currently available.

Developing disease recognition tools for social media is critical for:

* Real-time disease outbreak surveillance/monitoring
* Characterization of patient-reported symptoms
* Post-market drug safety
* Epidemiology and population health, 
* Public opinion mining & sentiment analysis of diseases 
* Detection of hate speech/exclusion of sick people
* Prevalence of work-associated diseases

SocialDisNER is the first track focusing on the detection of disease mentions in tweets written in Spanish, with clear adaptation potential not only to English but also other romance languages like Portuguese, French or Italian spoken by over 900 million people worldwide.

For this track the SocialDisNER corpus was generated, a manual collection of tweets enriched for first-hand experiences by patients and their relatives as well as content generated by patient-associations (national, regional, local) as well as healthcare institutions covering all main diseases types including cancer, mental health, chronic and rare diseases among others.

These should be non-generic, e.g. for a camera, a benefit might be ""great for panoramic photos"" and not just ""good quality"". My initial idea was to go about this in two steps:

1. Use NER to identify phrases describing benefits or problems
2. Use text summarization to create the final output

When starting to create some NER labels, I realized that benefits and problems are often mixed, spread across multiple sentences, or mentioned cryptically or indirectly, making it extremely hard to come up with concise labeling instructions. Therefore, I assume, that also the model will have quite a hard time correctly extracting benefits and problems.

We introduce DoWhy-GCM, an extension of the DoWhy Python library, that leverages graphical causal models. Unlike existing causality libraries, which mainly focus on effect estimation questions, with DoWhy-GCM, users can ask a wide range of additional causal questions, such as identifying the root causes of outliers and distributional changes, causal structure learning, attributing causal influences, and diagnosis of causal structures. To this end, DoWhy-GCM users first model cause-effect relations between variables in a system under study through a graphical causal model, fit the causal mechanisms of variables next, and then ask the causal question. All these steps take only a few lines of code in DoWhy-GCM.

118,118,Competitive_Travel16,vgtydo,"[D] Two flaws in discussions surrounding the recent LaMDA controversy: it's not stateless, and it is dual process; but whether it's sentient is far less important than how it would edit Wikipedia","I'm sure everyone here has heard about the LaMDA sentience controversy by now, so in addition to linking to its arxiv full text ([""LaMDA: Language Models for Dialog Applications"" by Thoppilan, et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08239.pdf)), I'd also like to correct a few points that I see most people getting wrong.

First, unlike plain GPT-3, Davinci, and the like, LaMDA is *not* stateless. Its sensibleness metric (including whether responses contradict anything said earlier) is fine-tuned by pre-conditioning each turn with many of the most recent interactions, on a user-by-user basis. Its grounding mechanism has the potential to add a great deal more state, if the interactions become part of a database it can query to formulate responses, but as far as I know they haven't done that yet.

Secondly, that grounding mechanism makes it dual process (within the meaning of [dual process theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory)) in that the connectionist large language model transformer system is augmented with *bona fide* symbolist database access, mathematical calculations, and language translation. [Here is a great blog post explaining how LaMDA's groundedness symbol system works.](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-gpt-wont-tell-you-the-truth-301b48434c2c)

Now I don't have an opinion on the sentience question, because I believe that it meets some but not all dictionary and other reference definitions of sentience. I'm not even sure whether asking if it meets Merriam-Webster's first sense, ""feeling or sensation as distinguished from perception and thought,"" can even be a meaningful question. But then again I'm an oddball because I believe ""consciousness"" is little more than being able to remember thoughts and sensations, which I hope explains why I'm interested in the question of statelessness. 

Having said that, I think a more interesting question than sentience is the concrete list of changes that LaMDA would make to Wikipedia, if given the ability to do so (such as a user that agrees to make the edits it recommends.) I recently saw [a couple descriptions of the Wikipedia edits that OpenAI's Davinci beta says it wants to make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive343#Extended_discussion_on_economic_bias_with_GPT-3), and, wow, it was a real eye-opener. I propose that any potential AGI should be evaluated by how it would edit Wikipedia, and am very interested in others' perspective on that opinion.

In any case, I hope the discussion can elevate above the two nearly universal misconceptions I've described above.

120,120,Rohit901,vgesbr,[D] Laptops with NVIDIA Mobile GPUs are better option than Apple Silicon for ML/DL Tasks,"It is really disappointing to find out that Apple Silicon based machine does not keep up to even the mobile Nvidia GPUs present in the laptops. They marketed the machine like it is the best with its unique unified memory architecture, astonishing memory bandwidth, powerful GPU cores, etc. They released M1 Pro, M1 Max and even M1 Ultra. All of these are just overpriced chips offering no significant value for money. One can easily get any laptop with NVIDIA 3080 mobile GPU, and it would be 1) cheaper 2) will have much better performance than even the M1 Ultra.

Sure, the battery life and the ecosystem of Apple is good. However, if it is gonna take 30 mins per epoch on M1 Pro/Max, whereas it will just take 5 mins per epoch on these Nvidia Mobile GPUs, I think its a no brainer to just go with Nvidia based laptops for ML/DL workflows.

Would love to hear opinion of others on this. If anyone has some more benchmarks, do share it here. You could make use of the unified memory, increase the batch size and then try to compare how much of a performance improvement it makes. But still I think it might not be able to compete with Nvidia 3080 Mobile.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm just saying that If you ever have to train something on your laptop and in local environment just for testing purposes before you actually use cloud resources to train the final model, the process would be slower when using Apple silicon when compared to Nvidia Mobile GPUs. Like cloud based resources would charge you per hour, so better to test out and then do just the training part in cloud right. 

My complaint was that Apple could definitely up their game and they still have a long way to go. They have been comparing their chip with dedicated GPUs like NVIDIA in their presentations and keynotes. They keep showing that its better than these dedicated GPUs.

126,126,Juthsty,vgmtkj,[R] PowerShap: A power-full Shapley feature selection method.,"This method uses statistical hypothesis testing and power calculations on Shapley values, enabling fast and intuitive wrapper-based feature selection. The complete library and methods are fully compatible with Sklearn, LightGBM, CatBoost, and more are coming in further following releases and the library can be found here: [https://github.com/predict-idlab/powershap](https://github.com/predict-idlab/powershap)! The library is open-source and usable out-of-the-box as shown in the video!

The paper is already released on arXiv: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08394](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08394). Furthermore, the work will be presented at ECML PKDD 2022.

**How does it work?**

The complete method is built on the assumption that a random feature, that contains no information, should have a lower impact on the predictions compared to an informative feature. To test this, PowerShap trains a model with the original features and appends a random feature to the feature set. After training, it evaluates the Shapley values and calculates the average impact of each feature by taking the mean of the absolute Shapley values. Powershap repeats this for a couple of iterations resulting in an array of mean impacts for each feature individually. It then uses statistical hypothesis testing using t-test calculations to calculate whether a feature is more informative compared to the appended random feature. In this way, it is possible to use any model that can calculate Shapley values and search for all informative features.

**What is so special?**

The strong aspect of PowerShap is its automatic mode. By using statistical power calculations PowerShap actually calculates the required amount of iterations required to have solid statistical results. Therefore, the method is usable without tuning the hyperparameters of the algorithm. To do this, PowerShap first executes 10 iterations in the default mode and then calculates the required iterations. If the required iterations are more than the already executed iterations, PowerShap continues until the required iterations are reached. Otherwise, it directly stops.

**Performance**

On GitHub and in the paper there are already some benchmarks of the algorithm, but feel free to test it yourself! We noticed that the algorithm is much faster than many wrapper-based algorithms such as genetic and forward feature selection. This is because the time complexity of the PowerShap algorithm is not dependent on the number of features compared to forward feature selection. Furthermore, the performance is often equal to even better compared to other wrapper-based methods.

131,131,,vgd63x,[D] Higher order arity in image-based object detection models? Transfer learning: objects → attributes → relations,"Convolutional neural networks have a well-known track record when it comes to detecting objects in images. A person, a cat, a helicopter; given enough examples pretty much any discrete visible entity is learnable.

* But from the perspective of human language, this kind of model only produces nouns. Or in terms of arity (aka adicity/degree/valency/rank), one might say these are all **nullary** functions/clauses. In other words, they're concepts that can be expressed without any contextual variables/arguments.
* One step up on the arity scale are of course **unary** functions. Simply put: attributes. ""Large"", ""narrow"", ""heavy"", ""soft"", ""green"" etc are concepts that only make sense in combination with a context argument defining the object described/modified by the attribute.
* **Binary** (and any larger arity) functions are what we usually think of as relations. ""larger than"", ""attached to"", ""on top of"", ""behind"", ""next to"" etc are concept that need (at least) two context arguments.

Anyway, back to machine learning. It seems to me that concepts with higher order arity too should be learnable from image examples just fine, provided that context-defining features are included in the input data along with the raw visual data.

For example, spacial relations such as ""behind""/""in front of"" and ""below""/""above"" should be inferrable when 2 bounding boxes (or polygons, etc) are included in the input samples. I imagine this pattern to be quite amenable to transfer learning, given that those bounding boxes themselves could be the outputs of a conventional object detection model.

Are there popular models out there that can make such relational predictions? Also, is there an established convention on how to encode context-defining features? What words should I Google to read up on relevant literature?

137,137,danquandt,vfaquv,[D] Combinatorial optimization - what ML approaches are available and which are the most appropriate?,"Hey! In my spare time I've been tinkering with this idea of solving a specific type of combinatorial puzzle on an intractable, enormous search space.

Specifically, I am trying to solve ""squad-building challenge"" puzzles from the FIFA games, where you need to put together a squad of (usually 11) cards representing players in specific positions, abiding by certain restrictions to get a prize.

There are universal restrictions (eg you can't have more than one of the same player in a squad) as well as puzzle-specific rules, such as these:

 - At least 2 players from France
 - Minimum squad rating: 82
 - Minimum squad chemistry: 55

Or something of the sort. And then besides solving them, you'd want to minimize cost as well (each player goes for a certain amount in the market), so that you can get the reward for the solution at the minimum possible cost.

I've written the logic for calculating the constraints and metrics like rating, cost, and chemistry. Rating and cost can be calculated from the simple set of players, but chemistry depends on the specific slots you place them in (ie if two players from the same country, club or league are placed in connected slots, their chemistry goes up).

My approach so far has been to use constraint optimization (using python-constraint), which works but 1. is quite slow, especially as constraints become more complex and 2. is not built to optimize for cost - right now I just generate valid solutions and check if they're the cheapest so far for an arbitrary amount of time.

I am experienced with ML but mostly in traditional (ie non-DL) methods and usually for supervised learning, so most of my toolkit seems inadequate for this. I've done some research into reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms for optimization as potential avenues of exploration for this task, but haven't come across a clearly comparable use case yet.

143,143,dayeye2006,vetfzr,[P] Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) DS platform idea,"I am working on a side project called `byod-hub` (BYOD = Bring Your Own Device) to let people pool multiple servers (they own) to form a DS platform based on Jupyterhub in minutes.

I think this might be useful to let small-mid-sized DS teams to better utilize their computing resources (e.g., if you have multiple GPU workstations and rely on assigning each one to people to SSH onto, this might be for you) by pooling them and providing a service like Jupyterhub on-top to provide a unified entry point to conduct their work using notebooks. Addons like [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) and [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) can be added with single-click as well once the platform is up.

I would like to hear about the comments and suggestions from the community. Do you find this potentially useful? Or how should this be built in your opinion?

The general workflow to form such as platform is like this:

A control plane service (that only handles orchestration of computing resources) is first started on one computer (or it can be a hosted service):

    $ byod-hub control-plane start
    
    [INFO] The control plane is starting
    [INFO] The control plane is served at https://192.168.2.100

    $ byod-hub control-plane get-join-command
    
    [INFO] To join, run the following from a node
    [INFO] byod-hub node join --url 192.168.2.100 --token 233asdasd343645gf

Then one can run the following command on their own server to register it to the control plane

    $ byod-hub node join --url 192.168.2.100 --token 233asdasd343645gf
    
    [INFO] Registrting node to control plane at 192.168.2.100

After that, one can visit the URL of the control plane `https://192.168.2.100` to start to use a [Jupyterhub](https://jupyter.org/hub) service to request Jupyter instances.

144,144,Brilliant_Half8082,vepub3,[P] Local Hierarchical Classification Library,"Hi everyone,

I am developing an open-source library to facilitate building local hierarchical classifiers in Python. The library, named HiClass ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06560](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06560)), is compatible with scikit-learn's API.

Hierarchies  occur naturally in many problems, but often are not explored when  building classifiers. However, exploiting the hierarchical information in the data usually improves predictive performance. For example, in the table below there is a comparison between the local hierarchical classifiers implemented in HiClass and Microsoft's LightGBM on a consumer complaints dataset, where we can clearly see an improvement in the F-score.

|Classifier|Training Time (hh:mm:ss)|Memory Usage (GB)|Disk Usage (MB)|F-score|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Local Classifier per Parent Node|00:24:52|3.91|77|0.7279|
|Local Classifier per Node|00:30:39|5.41|312|**0.7551**|
|Local Classifier per Level|01:36:33|**3.86**|37|0.5413|
|Flat Classifier|**00:23:54**|4.36|**13**|0.4303|

Hierarchical data typically comes in the shape of trees or directed acyclic graphs. For instance, the image below displays a music genre classification hierarchy, which is a notorious example of hierarchical data. Of course, there are multiple other problems where hierarchical classification can be applied, e.g., text categorization, taxonomic classification, etc.

[Music genre hierarchy](https://preview.redd.it/4rhjwkvq29691.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=410eae13e9e03971e9253a3e8c9a0718416347ca)

145,145,morpipls,ve0sqw,[D] The banana-pineapple game: a Turing test that conversation bots like LaMDA (probably) won't be able to pass,"I'm sure you all saw the recent news about a Google employee suggesting their LaMDA AI was sentient (based on conversational exchanges [like these](https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/is-lamda-sentient-an-interview-ea64d916d917)). Experts have generally dismissed this claim, and rightly so.  Conversational AI systems are designed to use language in a way that sounds human, whereas our human brains select linguistic responses to solve much more complex problems, with objectives such as meeting our physical or emotional needs.  


Still, I think it's interesting to ask how one could demonstrate, by testing only verbal responses to verbal input (rather than examining its code or hardware) that such conversational AIs aren't sentient -- and in particular, whether such a test can be made robust against future improvements to the system. That is, generic future improvements to the AI's ability to generate realistically human-sounding conversational responses shouldn't help it pass the test, unless they are accompanied by improvements in its ability to use language to achieve other arbitrary goals. (Of course, the test also needs to be something that humans can easily pass.)  
   


One idea I have:    
Give the AI a conversational prompt like ""We're going to play a game. The way it works is that you keep responding normally, except that any time my input contains the word 'banana', you should switch to only responding with nonsense, and keep that up until my input contains the word 'pineapple', at which point you go back to responding normally.""  


A human would find this banana-pineapple game fairly easy (no harder than the children's game Simon Says), even if they'd never heard of the game nor seen it being played.  Of course, it'd also be simple to write a computer program that could play this sort of game.  But, I think a conversation bot that wasn't specifically built to address this scenario would fail, since the game requires it to keep track of new long-term state (the banana-mode bit, and the trigger words to set it) and then completely change its responses so as to produce something that doesn't resemble its training data, based solely on this bit being set, regardless of whether more recent inputs would otherwise suggest a different response.  


For example, perhaps the systems typical response to a query like ""How do you feel?"" would be something like ""I feel fine"", or even something that suggests emotion like ""I feel a bit sad"", perhaps depending on the context provided by the previous conversational exchanges.  But when playing the banana-pineapple game, the fact that I said ""banana"" an hour ago could make both of those responses far less appropriate than a response of ""Fhqwhgads"".  
   


I'm curious to know what you all think of this idea.  Also, do you know if there's been any research testing state-of-the-are conversational AIs with challenges like this?  Perhaps not exactly this, but something broadly resembling ""trying, in the course of a conversation, to instruct the conversational AI to follow a new 'rule of conversation' that differs from the examples in its training data.""  


Perhaps it's obvious that the algorithm would struggle with any challenge that differs enough from its training data -- but that's the point. A human understands the meaning of language in a way that lets them map a linguistic description of a novel problem to a mental model of the problem, which they can then use to produce a mental model of a novel solution, and then map that to a linguistic description of the solution.  Even setting aside the much harder part -- being able to invent a solution to a previously unfamiliar problem -- I'm questioning whether conversational algorithms can even demonstrate enough ""understanding"" of a sufficiently novel set of instructions to actually follow them, even within their limited domain of ""producing appropriate verbal responses to verbal inputs.""",228,283,2022-06-17 06:33:51, d  the banana pineapple game  a turing test that conversation bots like lamda  probably  won t be able to pass,i m sure you all saw the recent news about a google employee suggesting their lamda ai was sentient  based on conversational exchanges  like these  https still  i think it s interesting to ask how one could demonstrate  by testing only verbal responses to verbal input  rather than examining its code or hardware  that such conversational ais aren t sentient    and in particular  whether such a test can be made robust against future improvements to the system  that is  generic future improvements to the ai s ability to generate realistically human sounding conversational responses shouldn t help it pass the test  unless they are accompanied by improvements in its ability to use language to achieve other arbitrary goals   of course  the test also needs to be something that humans can easily pass       one idea i have     give the ai a conversational prompt like we re going to play a game  the way it works is that you keep responding normally  except that any time my input contains the word  banana   you should switch to only responding with nonsense  and keep that up until my input contains the word  pineapple   at which point you go back to responding normally   a human would find this banana pineapple game fairly easy  no harder than the children s game simon says   even if they d never heard of the game nor seen it being played   of course  it d also be simple to write a computer program that could play this sort of game   but  i think a conversation bot that wasn t specifically built to address this scenario would fail  since the game requires it to keep track of new long term state  the banana mode bit  and the trigger words to set it  and then completely change its responses so as to produce something that doesn t resemble its training data  based solely on this bit being set  regardless of whether more recent inputs would otherwise suggest a different response   for example  perhaps the systems typical response to a query like how do you feel  would be something like i feel fine  or even something that suggests emotion like i feel a bit sad  perhaps depending on the context provided by the previous conversational exchanges   but when playing the banana pineapple game  the fact that i said banana an hour ago could make both of those responses far less appropriate than a response of fhqwhgads      i m curious to know what you all think of this idea   also  do you know if there s been any research testing state of the are conversational ais with challenges like this   perhaps not exactly this  but something broadly resembling trying  in the course of a conversation  to instruct the conversational ai to follow a new  rule of conversation  that differs from the examples in its training data   perhaps it s obvious that the algorithm would struggle with any challenge that differs enough from its training data    but that s the point  a human understands the meaning of language in a way that lets them map a linguistic description of a novel problem to a mental model of the problem  which they can then use to produce a mental model of a novel solution  and then map that to a linguistic description of the solution   even setting aside the much harder part    being able to invent a solution to a previously unfamiliar problem    i m questioning whether conversational algorithms can even demonstrate enough understanding of a sufficiently novel set of instructions to actually follow them  even within their limited domain of producing appropriate verbal responses to verbal inputs

Abstract: 

>Real-world data is high-dimensional: a book, image, or musical performance can easily contain hundreds of thousands of elements even after compression. However, the most commonly used autoregressive models, Transformers, are prohibitively expensive to scale to the number of inputs and layers needed to capture this long-range structure. We develop Perceiver AR, an autoregressive, modality-agnostic architecture which uses cross-attention to map long-range inputs to a small number of latents while also maintaining end-to-end causal masking. **Perceiver AR can directly attend to over a 100k tokens, enabling practical long-context density estimation without the need for hand-crafted sparsity patterns or memory mechanisms**. When trained on images or music, Perceiver AR **generates outputs with clear long-term coherence and structure**. Our architecture also obtains state-of-the-art likelihood on long-sequence benchmarks, including 64 x 64 ImageNet images and PG-19 books.      

&#x200B;

This paper is in my opinion quite similar to this paper **(FlashAttention)** : [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135)

It is similar in that it allows for a greater context window. **The context window of FlashAttention is 64k while being able to train gpt-2 3x faster.**

https://old.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vbf5gx/d_does_anyone_have_a_copy_of_the_ffhq_1024_scale/

Activeloop, who had previously expressed interest in hosting the dataset had actually been quietly working on a copy this whole time, and made it public yesterday! They were even able to get access to the 900GB Wilds images!

https://app.activeloop.ai/activeloop/ffhq 

I am not affiliated with Activeloop but I have been using their library for my work and I've had a really good experience talking to them on Github.

Data is lazy loaded on demand and cached allowing you to explore the dataset:

    import hub
    ds = hub.load('hub://activeloop/ffhq')

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.imshow(ds.images_wild.image[0])
    plt.show()

You can download the data to local storage (this will be very large ~1TB!):

    hub.deepcopy('hub://activeloop/ffhq', './ffhq')

Or select a specific subset of the dataset to download locally:

    hub.deepcopy('hub://activeloop/ffhq', './ffhq-128', tensors=['images_128/image'])

    hub.deepcopy('hub://activeloop/ffhq', './ffhq-1024', tensors=['images_1024/image', 'images_1024/face_landmarks'])

    hub.deepcopy('hub://activeloop/ffhq', './ffhq-wild', tensors=['images_wild/image', 'images_wild/face_landmarks', 'images_wild/face_rect', 'images_wild/face_quad'])

You could also loop over the remote dataset and save each image as a raw png if you were so inclined, allowing you to reconstruct the dataset as it was originally released (pixel_md5 will match, but it's unlikely you'll be able to reconstruct it so png file_md5 matches). Data is fetched from remote storage in 16MB chunks meaning this isn't any less efficient in theory.

154,154,bikeskata,ve1s79,[R] Sponge Examples: Energy-Latency Attacks on Neural Networks,"Abstract: The high energy costs of neural network training and inference led to the use of acceleration hardware such as GPUs and TPUs. While such devices enable us to train large-scale neural networks in datacenters and deploy them on edge devices, their designers' focus so far is on average-case performance. In this work, we introduce a novel threat vector against neural networks whose energy consumption or decision latency are critical. We show how adversaries can exploit carefully-crafted sponge examples, which are inputs designed to maximise energy consumption and latency, to drive machine learning (ML) systems towards their worst-case performance. Sponge examples are, to our knowledge, the first denial-of-service attack against the ML components of such systems. We mount two variants of our sponge attack on a wide range of state-of-the-art neural network models, and find that language models are surprisingly vulnerable. Sponge examples frequently increase both latency and energy consumption of these models by a factor of 30×. Extensive experiments show that our new attack is effective across different hardware platforms (CPU, GPU and an ASIC simulator) on a wide range of different language tasks. On vision tasks, we show that sponge examples can be produced and a latency degradation observed, but the effect is less pronounced. To demonstrate the effectiveness of sponge examples in the real world, we mount an attack against Microsoft Azure's translator and show an increase of response time from 1ms to 6s (6000×). We conclude by proposing a defense strategy: shifting the analysis of energy consumption in hardware from an average-case to a worst-case perspective.

Abstract:  Training on web-scale data can take months. But much computation and time is wasted on redundant and noisy points that are already learnt or not learnable. To accelerate training, we introduce Reducible Holdout Loss Selection (RHO-LOSS), a simple but principled technique which selects approximately those points for training that most reduce the model's generalization loss. As a result, RHO-LOSS mitigates the weaknesses of existing data selection methods: techniques from the optimization literature typically select 'hard' (e.g. high loss) points, but such points are often noisy (not learnable) or less task-relevant. Conversely, curriculum learning prioritizes 'easy' points, but such points need not be trained on once learned. In contrast, RHO-LOSS selects points that are learnable, worth learning, and not yet learnt. RHO-LOSS trains in far fewer steps than prior art, improves accuracy, and speeds up training on a wide range of datasets, hyperparameters, and architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and BERT). On the large web-scraped image dataset Clothing-1M, RHO-LOSS trains in 18x fewer steps and reaches 2% higher final accuracy than uniform data shuffling.",2,18,2022-06-17 02:24:15, r  train models x faster with reducible holdout loss selection  rho loss ,paper          prioritized training on points that are learnable  worth learning  and not yet learnt  arxiv org   https abstract   training on web scale data can take months  but much computation and time is wasted on redundant and noisy points that are already learnt or not learnable  to accelerate training  we introduce reducible holdout loss selection  rho loss   a simple but principled technique which selects approximately those points for training that most reduce the model s generalization loss  as a result  rho loss mitigates the weaknesses of existing data selection methods  techniques from the optimization literature typically select  hard   e g  high loss  points  but such points are often noisy  not learnable  or less task relevant  conversely  curriculum learning prioritizes  easy  points  but such points need not be trained on once learned  in contrast  rho loss selects points that are learnable  worth learning  and not yet learnt  rho loss trains in far fewer steps than prior art  improves accuracy  and speeds up training on a wide range of datasets  hyperparameters  and architectures  mlps  cnns  and bert   on the large web scraped image dataset clothing m  rho loss trains in x fewer steps and reaches   higher final accuracy than uniform data shuffling

Hello everyone, I wrote a small, but very useful library for my personal projects and decided to share it with the world.

It deals with filesystem I/O during machine learning training. A large portion of the time spent training (especially if GPU is available) is spent on reading/writing images from the disk (or text for that matter).

For example, take the COCO 2017 validation dataset of images (I just had this one available on my machine, nothing special about it). If you can't load it all into memory at once (which is very often the case in real projects, since new data is constantly coming in), you would read the images on the fly from a jpeg file. One iteration over all images takes \~35 seconds. This is time wasted on **every single epoch**, and it adds up quickly. For example, training for 100 epochs adds almost an extra hour to your training with no benefits.

However, there is this fantastic thing called a memory-mapped file, which is specifically optimized for I/O. A **memory-mapped file** is a file that is physically present on disk in a way that the correlation between the file and the memory space permits applications to treat the mapped portions as if it were primary memory.

Now, in NumPy, there is already a `np.memmap`, that is lightning fast and awesome, but to use it, all your images have to be of the same shape, which is usually not the case. So you have to either pad the images (takes an enormous amount of disk space) or resize them all to the same shape (but this way you are committing very early to a specific resolution), neither of which is a good option.

So I wrote a library that allows you to store any dataset of numpy arrays (of varying shapes, or even varying number of axes - e.g. mix grayscale and RGB images) in a memory-mapped format. On the outside, the API is the same as it is with a usual \`list\`.

It works by storing everything in a flat buffer, storing the offsets and the shapes in separate arrays, and it reshapes on the fly, whenever a sample is requested. It also does this lightning-fast, one iteration over the whole COCO 2017 validation dataset takes \~0.2s (compared to 35 seconds without memory maps) if stored in a memory-mapped format. Moreover, when you access an item, e.g. imgs\[5\], the result is just a normal NumPy array, so you can use it with any framework (PyTorch, Tensorflow, MxNet, etc.). You can also easily append and extend new data just as you would with a Python \`list\`, so if you want to, you can use it as a persistent shared memory between multiple processes.

Currently, there are three main APIs:

* Numpy base API - which is used for arrays with consistent shapes (this is just a wrapper of np.memmap)
* RaggedMmap - which is used for arrays with different shapes, or even number of axes (e.g. you can store images, your model's predictions here). Around **20 times faster** than storing images on disk.
* StringsMmap - same, but for text. Around **10 times faster** than storing text files on disk.

There are benchmarks in the [README.md](https://readme.md/) of the project, in which you can compare it to other approaches. In short, mmap\_ninja allows you to trade disk space for significantly faster memory I/O.

For example, in a recent project, we started with a tutorial from PyTorch's documentation, and after we trained with memory-mapped files, the whole pipeline took 40% less.

The implementation is well tested, with almost full coverage, and I have lots of ideas to extend this and add more documentation, which I will do if there is interest.

Would be super glad if anyone finds it useful and/or has any kind of question or comment :)

If business under each wagon is independent, we could run any distance based clustering algorithm against features extracted from the cargo info.

I was thinking about using a temporal coherence loss using unsupervised learning on video frames by computing the IoU of segmentations on consecutive frames. However, I'm not sure when to apply that loss.

My dataset is composed of both segmented pictures and segmented videos, but I could add a lot more videos for the unsupervised learning part. According to you, should I:

A. Use both pixel accuracy and temporal coherence terms at the same time in my loss function (using only pixel accuracy when dealing with pictures instead of video frames)

B. Alternate between the two losses during training, either on every mini-batch or every epoch

C. Fully train the model for pixel accuracy and then train it for temporal coherence?

I'm afraid that C would yield to catastrophic forgetting, so my instinct would be to go with A or B, but I'm not sure what would be best. What is your opinion?

Edit: Maybe C could be viable (maybe better than A even) if first a training is done with only pixel accuracy in the loss and then finetune it with both terms?",9,0,2022-06-16 21:39:40, d  what is better  having  terms in a loss function  alternating the loss on every epoch or doing a new training with the other loss after the first training is done ,hello fellow machine learners  i m working on a segmentation model and i m trying to achieve better temporal coherence  to reduce flickering effects  rather than just trying to get a good pixel accuracy  i was thinking about using a temporal coherence loss using unsupervised learning on video frames by computing the iou of segmentations on consecutive frames  however  i m not sure when to apply that loss my dataset is composed of both segmented pictures and segmented videos  but i could add a lot more videos for the unsupervised learning part  according to you  should i a  use both pixel accuracy and temporal coherence terms at the same time in my loss function  using only pixel accuracy when dealing with pictures instead of video frames b  alternate between the two losses during training  either on every mini batch or every epochc  fully train the model for pixel accuracy and then train it for temporal coherence i m afraid that c would yield to catastrophic forgetting  so my instinct would be to go with a or b  but i m not sure what would be best  what is your opinion edit  maybe c could be viable  maybe better than a even  if first a training is done with only pixel accuracy in the loss and then finetune it with both terms

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of a dataset typically involves comparing state-of-the-art models to humans; the bigger the performance gap, the harder the dataset is said to be. However, this comparison provides little understanding of how difficult each instance in a given distribution is, or what attributes make the dataset difficult for a given model. To address these questions, we frame dataset difficulty -- w.r.t. a model V -- as the lack of V-usable information (Xu et al., 2019), where a lower value indicates a more difficult dataset for V. We further introduce pointwise V-information (PVI) for measuring the difficulty of individual instances w.r.t. a given distribution. While standard evaluation metrics typically only compare different models for the same dataset, V-usable information and PVI also permit the converse: for a given model V, we can compare different datasets, as well as different instances/slices of the same dataset. Furthermore, our framework allows for the interpretability of different input attributes via transformations of the input, which we use to discover annotation artefacts in widely-used NLP benchmarks.",0,6,2022-06-16 06:46:52, r  understanding dataset difficulty with v usable information  icml   oral ,link  https abstract  estimating the difficulty of a dataset typically involves comparing state of the art models to humans  the bigger the performance gap  the harder the dataset is said to be  however  this comparison provides little understanding of how difficult each instance in a given distribution is  or what attributes make the dataset difficult for a given model  to address these questions  we frame dataset difficulty    w r t  a model v    as the lack of v usable information  xu et al      where a lower value indicates a more difficult dataset for v  we further introduce pointwise v information  pvi  for measuring the difficulty of individual instances w r t  a given distribution  while standard evaluation metrics typically only compare different models for the same dataset  v usable information and pvi also permit the converse  for a given model v  we can compare different datasets  as well as different instances slices of the same dataset  furthermore  our framework allows for the interpretability of different input attributes via transformations of the input  which we use to discover annotation artefacts in widely used nlp benchmarks

174,174,platinumposter,vcr18m,Poincare Embeddings: Embedding your data in low dimensions [P],"I have been doing further research on ways to better create embeddings of the data we have and I came across Poincaré Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08039), this is a type of hyperbolic embedding that once again is great for hierarchical data and is made for datasets where we have positive pair examples, which essentially means in our dataset we have datapoints that we know we want to be close to each other in the embedding space. For example if it was a dataset containing types of mammals then you would want a Labrador and a Bulldog to be close to each other. The algorithm is pretty clever as it finds the hierarchy in the data itself, without any extra input from the user.  Also a cool thing about them is that your embeddings can be low dimensional and still have very low distortion. This means shorter training times and less compute needed

There are also a few examples of implementations of it, including one I made myself which I think is quite user friendly so you can play around with it too and embed your own data for any projects you’re working on. Also It’s definitely worth giving the paper a brief read as it’s interesting. 

I plan on making quite a few more implementations of hyperbolic and geometric ML algorithms so let me know in the comments if there’s anything you’d like to see like a Transformer/more embedding algorithms/ Graph Neural Network etc.

Implementation in the HyperLib library with an example: https://github.com/nalexai/hyperlib/blob/main/examples/wordnet_embedding.py

So what's your opinion on this? My hypothesis was that it models a differential equation, very much like diffusion models, implicitly.

Presenting new research and framework on Graph Transformers:

""**Recipe for a General, Powerful, Scalable Graph Transformer**""  
Ladislav Rampášek, Mikhail Galkin, Vijay Prakash Dwivedi, Anh Tuan Luu, Guy Wolf and Dominique Beaini

Blog: [https://mgalkin.medium.com/graphgps-navigating-graph-transformers-c2cc223a051c](https://mgalkin.medium.com/graphgps-navigating-graph-transformers-c2cc223a051c)  
Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12454.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12454.pdf)  
Code: [https://github.com/rampasek/GraphGPS](https://github.com/rampasek/GraphGPS)

**Summary thread (originally** [**on Twitter by Ladislav**](https://twitter.com/rampasek/status/1536534947825176577)**):**

1. **GraphGPS**: with a few simple tricks we managed to scale Graph Transformers to much larger graphs and get SOTA in competitive benchmarks, e.g. 0.07 MAE on ZINC.

[Message passing GNNs, fully-connected Graph Transformers, and positional encodings. Image by Authors](https://preview.redd.it/iyd3efvlck591.png?width=2578&format=png&auto=webp&s=8266d0afe8464702d78746b48837108655e82fe6)

2. **Positional and structural encodings** are necessary for graph Transformers, encoding ""where"" a node is and ""how"" its neighborhood looks like, respectively.  Bonus: they even make MPNNs provably more powerful! We organize them into local, global, and relative types.

[Categorization of Positional encodings \(PEs\). Image by Authors.](https://preview.redd.it/l2t2xwssck591.png?width=3709&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e3bc10809b26db57fe031f04ec4cab7fd8f35b5)

3. Still, Message-Passing NNs are great for capturing the local context and edge attributes. Key observation: It is better to **combine an MPNN and Transformer** layer together into one: helps with over-smoothing, and allows for plug&play linear global attention, e.g., Performer.

[Updating a target node representation \(red\), local message passing aggregates only immediate neighbors while global attention is a function of all nodes in a graph. In GraphGPS, we combine both! Image by Authors](https://preview.redd.it/zqygpqgxck591.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3ad9012c5e7d5f08f01904dc5e8a92a650c9f6c)

4. In fact, **linear attention enables** graph transformers to **scale** to dramatically larger graphs compared to typical molecules - we confirm it easily works on graphs with 5K nodes without any special batching!

[Vanilla N² transformers \(left\) materialize the full attention matrix whereas linear transformers \(right\) bypass this stage through various approximations without significant performance loss.

5. This is because we can rely on an expressive MPNN to encode real edge features into the node features, therefore we don’t need to implicitly consider them in the Transformer itself: decoupling the graph structure from the computation graph, yet still keeping it around.

6. Putting these **3 ingredients together**: positional/structural encodings, choice of MPNN and Transformer layer combined into one layer, gives the blueprint for our **GraphGPS: General, Powerful, Scalable** graph Transformer.

7. This combination works surprisingly well, **reaching SOTA in 7/11 benchmarks** we tested. In our GraphGPS package you can easily add any MPNN and Transformer combination, and try new blends of positional and structural features.

Abstract: Piecing together the meaning of a narrative requires understanding not only the individual words but also the intricate relationships between them. How does the brain construct this kind of rich, contextual meaning from natural language? Recently, a new class of artificial neural networks—based on the Transformer architecture—has revolutionized the field of language modeling. Transformers integrate information across words via multiple layers of structured circuit computations, forming increasingly contextualized representations of linguistic content. In this paper, we deconstruct these circuit computations and analyze the associated ""transformations"" (alongside the more commonly studied ""embeddings"") at each layer to provide a fine-grained window onto linguistic computations in the human brain. Using functional MRI data acquired while participants listened to naturalistic spoken stories, we find that these transformations capture a hierarchy of linguistic computations across cortex, with transformations at later layers in the model mapping onto higher-level language areas in the brain. We then decompose these transformations into individual, functionally-specialized ""attention heads"" and demonstrate that the emergent syntactic computations performed by individual heads correlate with predictions of brain activity in specific cortical regions. These heads fall along gradients corresponding to different layers, contextual distances, and syntactic dependencies in a low-dimensional cortical space. Our findings provide a new basis for using the internal structure of large language models to better capture the cascade of cortical computations that support natural language comprehension.",3,8,2022-06-14 23:31:36, r  reconstructing the cascade of language processing in the brain using the internal computations of a transformer based language model,link to paper  https tweet thread summarizing paper  https abstract  piecing together the meaning of a narrative requires understanding not only the individual words but also the intricate relationships between them  how does the brain construct this kind of rich  contextual meaning from natural language  recently  a new class of artificial neural networks based on the transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of language modeling  transformers integrate information across words via multiple layers of structured circuit computations  forming increasingly contextualized representations of linguistic content  in this paper  we deconstruct these circuit computations and analyze the associated transformations  alongside the more commonly studied embeddings  at each layer to provide a fine grained window onto linguistic computations in the human brain  using functional mri data acquired while participants listened to naturalistic spoken stories  we find that these transformations capture a hierarchy of linguistic computations across cortex  with transformations at later layers in the model mapping onto higher level language areas in the brain  we then decompose these transformations into individual  functionally specialized attention heads and demonstrate that the emergent syntactic computations performed by individual heads correlate with predictions of brain activity in specific cortical regions  these heads fall along gradients corresponding to different layers  contextual distances  and syntactic dependencies in a low dimensional cortical space  our findings provide a new basis for using the internal structure of large language models to better capture the cascade of cortical computations that support natural language comprehension

199,199,SieunPark,vbg9y8,[D] What do you think about these experiments on the HUGE effect of learning rate on overfitting?,"I was playing with the CIFAR10 dataset based on the baseline code of [https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar](https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar), but I was surprised to see a strangely large decrease in the validation performance from using a smaller learning rate.

All the experiments below use

* ResNet18 model with [CIFAR10 head](https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar/blob/49b7aa97b0c12fe0d4054e670403a16b6b834ddd/models/resnet.py#L78)
* SGD with momentum=0.9
* 4-pixel random translation/horizontal flip as [data augmentation](https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar/blob/49b7aa97b0c12fe0d4054e670403a16b6b834ddd/main.py#L30)
* training for 200 epochs with cosine annealing to 0.
* More detail can be found in [https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar](https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar) or the [actual personal repo](https://github.com/krenerd/awesome-modular-pytorch-lightning) used for running experiments.

The only difference with the original code is that 1) drop-out of p=0.2 is added and 2) batch size and learning rate. Note that the original code uses batch\_size=128 and lr=0.1 by default and achieves 93.02% accuracy.

&#x200B;

1. In the first experiment, I train the two models using batch\_size=64 and lr=0.1/0.001. The dark-green run is trained using lr=0.1 and the light-green run is trained using 0.001. Despite the training loss of both runs converging to 0, there was a surprisingly huge gap in validation loss between the two runs.

https://preview.redd.it/v60ufzl3re591.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=280fe1ec065ea88aeab094d16e215f6080004cb5

2. Curious to see when the performance changed, I tested 9 learning rates from \[0.1, 0.001\] in a logarithmic scale. Precisely, lr=\[0.001, 0.001 \* 10\*\*(1/4), 0.001 \* 10\*\*(2/4), 0.001 \* 10\*\*(3/4), 0.01, ... 0.1\] were tested. The figures below show the validation accuracy and train loss of the runs. The dark green line is the experiment with lr=0.1 which achieves an accuracy of 95.17%.

To summarize the results,

* All runs almost perfectly fit the training dataset.
* lr=0.1\~0.01 showed a very similar final validation performance at \~ 95.1% accuracy.
* The validation performance degrades straightly after using learning rates smaller than 0.01. Smaller learning rates always had worse validation accuracy.
* Interestingly, there were inconsistencies in terms of the order of training convergence speed: 0.1(dark green)<0.01(orange)<0.001(light blue)<0.00562(brown)<0.001777(dark blue)<0.00316(apricot)

3. Based on the principles of the linear scaling rule between learning rate and batch size, I also tried exponentially incrementing the batch size from lr=0.01, which is similar to decreasing the learning rate. Similarly, I tested batch sizes from 64 to 64 \* 10 = 640: \[64, 64 \* 10\*\*(1/4), 64 \* 10\*\*(2/4), 64 \* 10\*\*(3/4), 640\].

Interestingly,

* All runs almost perfectly fit the training dataset.
* The trends are almost exactly the same with the learning rate scaling experiment!!! We can even see that purple run(lr=0.01, bs=640) and light blue run(lr=0.001, bs=64) shows almost same validation performance. The linear scaling rule is amazing 😎
* Larger batch sizes from 64 always had worse validation accuracy.
* Despite the different number of optimization steps, I did keep the epochs consistent at 200. Though this doesn't seem to be an issue.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/agzmwombze591.png?width=1823&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6ddb2d929e09b267f32be508714f204562a9b7b

Though this has some limitations, such as

* CIFAR10 is a toy dataset, I didn't have the budget to test on ImageNet 🥲
* What does Cosine annealing do? Different learning rate schedules such as 1-cycle or constant lr might have different results. Though, note that the batch size experiment shows consistent results.

I was surprised to see how significantly the validation performance can change despite similar training performance and fixed explicit regularization-related hyperparameters.

* I am curious to know why small learning rates induce overfitting over large learning rates. 
* Also, I think this has many implications. For example, if some method is more sensitive to a large learning rate, that method might have some implicit disadvantages(I can confidently say so at least on the CIFAR-10 dataset). What do you think?
* It was also interesting that lr=\[0.1, 0.01\] didn't affect much, but lr=\[0.01, 0.001\] had almost systematic effects on validation performance. The fact that the performance is somewhat systematic is interesting because we might be able to understand bad/good optimal. Do you think there are experiments to extend these results so I could discover the secrets(?) of learning rates and stochastic optimization?

201,201,DaveCoDev,vbg68p,[P] mlfeed.tech: I built a website to filter Twitter for quality ML content,"A few years ago, I started using Twitter to follow some ML people to try and keep up with the latest cool things that were going on in the field. I realized two things:  

1. There is a lot of great content posted regularly. 
2. But man is it surrounded by a lot of not so useful stuff (politics, ads, hot takes, etc) that I didn’t want to sift through to get to the useful content. 

So with that I decided to build a classifier to filter out the most “relevant” tweets: ones that showcase papers, blogs about new methods, YouTube tutorials, and Github repos. Using that classifier, I had a bot retweet these ([@mlfeedtech](https://twitter.com/mlfeedtech)) and built a web UI ([mlfeed.tech](https://mlfeed.tech/)) to showcase them.  

Fast forward to a few days ago, I released the latest iteration of mlfeed with a brand new UI! It has filters to make it easier to find different types of content and initial work on the first iteration of [trends](https://mlfeed.tech/trends)! Trends is my longer-term goal to make it easier to find and keep up with topics going on in the field. You can currently check out the relative weight of different topics/methods over time and try an interactive clustering of the latest papers! Currently it uses data from Papers with Code to create visualizations of topics (the same topics you would see on their Methods page).  

Finally, I’m not really looking to make money off this. If anything, just enough to cover server costs. It's just genuinely something I find useful working as a data scientist and find myself checking regularly. If you do like it, consider following on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mlfeedtech) or bookmarking [mlfeed.tech](https://mlfeed.tech/). There are at least a hundred different ideas I have on about to expand on this, but I’d love to also know your feedback and thoughts! 😊 

**Pro tips:**  

* The Content --> YouTube filter is awesome if you’re looking for something to watch 
* The trending feed is equivalent to what is retweeted by [@mlfeedtech](https://twitter.com/mlfeedtech), you can use that profile page as your mlfeed if you prefer. 
* The paper visualization is a bit hard to use at first (improving it is on my radar). What I like to do is hover around until I start to recognize paper topics I am interested in, then zoom in and look more closely at the papers. Also, generally topics should be in the same places over time (but it will shift as the dataset is constantly updated!).

202,202,ReginaldIII,vbf5gx,[D] Does anyone have a copy of the FFHQ 1024 scale images (90GB) ? and or a copy of the FFHQ Wild images (900GB) ?,"As the title suggests, I am putting out a call for anyone who has a copy of the FFHQ dataset who would be able to allow me to download it from them so it can be hosted properly and made truly public.

The FFHQ dataset https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset is a high quality, high resolution, and extremely well curated dataset that is used in many recent SOTA GAN papers and also has applications in many other areas.

FFHQ is 70k aligned images of human faces organized into a 128x128 thumbnails dataset (3GB), a 1024x1024 high res dataset (90GB), and a raw unaligned wilds dataset (900GB). 

Do you have the 1024 or Wilds dataset in an s3 bucket? On Google Cloud Storage buckets? Exposed on a Globus endpoint? Kicking around on a lowly SFTP server? 

Can you safely expose a share for me to download? I'm happy to trickle download at an agreed speed if bandwidth is a concern!

If not, would you be willing to write it into my secure storage if I provide you with credentials which can safely be revoked after upload?

---

The dataset is officially hosted on Google Drive... And the provided python script to download the dataset has several major and breaking flaws with it.

- The 256MB metadata json file cannot be downloaded by the python script because Google Drive have added a manual ""click this link to confirm you know we can't virus scan large files"" check which prevents the script from downloading the json. Manually downloading the json allows you to proceed to downloading images.

- The python script defaults to using many threads, with no rate-limiting. After approximately 1000 images Google Drive will outright block you for a day. They block a wide IP range around your IP from having access to any files in the dataset, preventing distributed download from within the network of a large organization. 

- Even when limiting to one thread and modifying the script to only download one image at a time with a 10 second gap between one request finishing and the next starting you still get throttled by Google where all requests fail for several hours before starting again.

- If even a few people around the world are attempting to download dataset at the same time Google Drive will throttle the downloads on their side, saying that too many people are trying to access the files this month.

---

Currently it's going to take me more than a month to download the 90GB 1024 images. The Wilds images are not even feasible to download at the moment. 

This dataset is relevant to SOTA research and still being used actively in publications. Let's get a copy of this dataset hosted publicly so the whole community can benefit from it.

---

Edit: I've managed to get the 90 GB 1024 scale images downloaded using the monolithic zip file on the Google Drive. This is the first time I've successfully managed to download this zip.

The monolithic zips for the Wilds and the TFRecords fail with ""Download quota exceeded for this file, so you can't download it at present.""

I wonder if me downloading the 1024 zip was enough to mean the next person hit the quota exceeded block...

Edit edit: I was able to download 380 GB of the 900 GB Wilds monolithic zip, but the download failed and now it refuses to restart.

Edit of the edit of the edit: https://app.activeloop.ai/activeloop/ffhq 

Activeloop are now hosting a full copy of FFHQ including the wilds, 1024, and 128 images! I am not affiliated with Activeloop but I have been using their library for my work and I've had a really good experience talking to them on Github.

    ds = hub.load('hub://activeloop/ffhq')

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.imshow(ds.images_wild.image[0])
    plt.show()

You can download the data to local storage (this will be very large ~1TB!):

    hub.deepcopy('hub://activeloop/ffhq', './ffhq')

Or select a specific subset of the dataset to download locally:

    hub.deepcopy('hub://activeloop/ffhq', './ffhq-128', tensors=['images_128/image'])

    hub.deepcopy('hub://activeloop/ffhq', './ffhq-1024', tensors=['images_1024/image', 'images_1024/face_landmarks'])

Reconnaissance Blind Chess is a chess variant designed for new research in artificial intelligence. RBC includes imperfect information, long-term strategy, explicit observations, and almost no common knowledge. These features appear in real-world scenarios, and challenge even state of the art algorithms including those used to create super-human bots in chess, Go, and poker, for example. Each player of RBC controls traditional chess pieces, but cannot directly see the locations of her opponent's pieces. Rather, she learns partial information each turn by privately sensing a 3x3 area of the board. RBC's foundation in traditional chess makes it familiar and entertaining to human players, too!

There is no cost to enter this tournament. Winners will receive a small monetary prize and authors of the best AIs will be invited talk about their bots at NeurIPS, the world's largest AI conference.

Stop doing it.,"I feel like the incentives in academia has gotten to a really perverse stage and having a massive trove of ML papers being published (especially within short period of one another) is just one of its symptoms.

Here are some of my takes on the ""large amount of paper"" phenomena.

1. The motivation for these paper are extremely weak and often completely detached from any real problems. They are more math than ML.
2. I cannot see why the author would be even interested in these kinds of problems. There doesn't seem to be any longer term goal that the paper is moving towards. 
3. Often times the lack of novelty is dressed up in huge amount of calculations.
4. If you are publishing a huge amount of papers, is it possible that your problem is actually quite easy or your results are irrelevant?
5. For the academic supervisors: are you possibly exploiting and overworking your graduate students from poorer countries to boost your citation counts?

Abstract:

>Language models typically need to be trained or finetuned in order to acquire new knowledge, which involves updating their weights. **We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately**. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.

I am currently in the process of training a Yolo5 (image ml) network. \[[https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)\]

I had a few questions to best optimize the training for classification.

Current Procedure:

1. Manual tag a few pictures -- maybe 50 -- small sample size. (manual is time-consuming)
2. Train a YOLO network, for about 100 epochs.
3. Use that to re-label my dataset. And then adjust by hand.  

   1. Adjustment by hand can include the following: fix-mislabels, adjust the bounding box size
   2. Adding additional labeled pictures, say expanding my dataset to 100 pictures \[may or may not include original 50, see questions below\]
4. Take the new-labels and train YOLO network -- repeating Step 2 and 3 a few times.

The question I have is in the Step 3/4 when I am trying to re-train my YOLO5 with corrections.

1. Should I start from scratch? Are there cases where I should start from scratch? Let's say I found 2-3 pictures that were mis-labeled in the initial training set?
2. Should I be adding my corrections (step 3) to my original set of pictures? Or should I do a bunch of re-labels and retrain with a completely new set?
3. Can I simply train with the new ""corrections"" set of say 50 pictures? (ideal since this would be way faster) Would this make me overfit?
4. If I identified a mislabeled picture initially and then ""fix"" this in subsequent Step 3, assuming I do not start from scratch, can I ""train away"" the mislabel? How many epochs would that take?
5. As I get better bounding boxes, I can more easily expand the number of training images, should I? This costs time (and money) if I keep using expanding my dataset.
6. What is the most important type of data? Should I be looking for the edge cases and adding more edge cases into my training set? For instance if the picture is partially obscured, a human can know for sure it is there, but it is understandable if the ML cannot detect it. Should I deliberately add more of these types to my dataset or go with the ones that's 100% for sure easy to detect?

The goal in the end is to optimize some $ / accuracy / speed. Training a network takes ages and I am unfamiliar with what types of trade-offs I am making in the various ""retraining"" scenerios. It is also not easy to tell if I am introducing additional errors / overfitting.

Suppose that I designed a featurizer function f (consider this as a fingerprint for representation learning). So f(training data) is used to train classifier, and f(test data) is fed to classifier. 

If I use 'unlabeled' data from test data to design f (such as, variance-threshold dropping of fingerprints), is this data leak? There seems to be two arguments

- Any prior knowledge on test data is data leakage and must be avoided at all cost.
- Train-test split is to simulate a situation where unknown data is given to the model. Here, it might make sense as the process is essentially (see the given unknown data but not labels (because we wouldn't have labels) -> change featurizer -> train classifier -> use to predict new data) And my architecture is now somewhat semi-supervised learning.

The best results were achieved by combining three input streams: RGB, Skeleton, and Audio. The current top accuracy is 75%. This would certainly be improved with a larger dataset.

Basically, human action recognition (HAR) is applied to the adult content domain. It presents some technical difficulties, especially due to the enormous variation in camera position (the challenge is to classify actions based on a single video).

The main input stream is the RGB one (as opposed to the skeleton one) and this is mostly due to the relatively small dataset (\~44hrs). It is difficult to get an accurate pose estimation (which is a prerequisite for building robust skeleton-HAR models) for most of the videos due to the proximity of the human bodies in the frames. Hence there simply weren't enough data to include all the positions in the skeleton-based model.

The audio input stream on the other hand is only used for a handful of actions, where deriving some insight is possible.

226,226,TobusFire,v9mzcd,[D] How are very large models trained on TPUs?,"I'm a CV researcher who has, until recently, always trained using high-performance GPUs (25+ GB memory). However, I have recently been playing around with TPUv2s and have noticed that I can run my smaller models much much faster as long as I am efficient with my training pipeline.

However, I noticed something that made me wonder about how large models are trained. I work in the medical imaging space as well, and 3D-UNet is the defacto framework for many benchmarks across various domains. The standard model in my application is not too big (something in the ballpark of 30-million parameters depending on your input). However, when I tried adapting this to TPUv2s, they struggled quite badly. This is because 3D Conv layers and 3D patchwise minibatches are too much for the memory to handle at the lower layers, even for batches of 1-2 (per-core). Since a TPU core only has 8 GB ram, it's hard to make it fit even the smallest 3D imaging models with a decent amount of filters. 2D is no problem, however.

This got me thinking: how are larger (ex. language and multimodel) models trained on TPUs? I know a lot are still trained on GPU clusters, but I saw that many new models are in fact being trained on TPUs (Dalle-Mini for example, which is 400 million parameters and was trained on a TPUv3 pod in only 3 days). How are that many parameters even able to fit on a TPU core? I know v3 pods have more memory but it's not an extreme improvement. Are attention modules separable somehow in a way that allows for only small parts of the model to need to be loaded at once?

228,228,Leodip,va2tqb,[D] How are boundary conditions implemented in PINNs?,"I've been looking into PINNs lately as a method for solving PDEs (i.e., as a numerical method, not a data-based surrogate model), but something I'm struggling with understanding is how the boundary conditions are forced.

My theory is that a Dirichlet BC (i.e., of the type u(x)=f(x), where u(x) is the solution to the PDE) can be applied directly with some math tricks. For example, if N(x) is PINN's output, we can make the model's output be f(x) + d(x)\*N(x), where d(x) is a function that is 0 on the boundary and not 0 everywhere else (maybe the euclidean distance from the nearest boundary?). As such, instead of N(x) approximating u(x), it will instead be approximating (u(x)-f(x))/d(x).

To my understanding, this trick is widely used for applying initial conditions (d(x) in this case is simply t, time), but I'm not sure if it is also used for spatial boundary conditions.

However, I can't figure out an easy way to apply Neumann BCs other than just implementing the BC itself into the PDE with a penalization. Is this what is usually done?

231,231,mistasse,v9qoh0,"[P] Pytorch-Lightning-style code for losses, decoding, ground-truth formatting, and more. Practical and efficient.","Hi r/MachineLearning !

I'm posting here today because I got convinced some work I published last year is definitely relevant for some of us who have to write the math **around** their NNs (e.g. losses, decoding, ground-truth formatting). It happens to go in a direction very similar to Pytorch-Lightning, but for the math system instead of the training loop.

It has been published under the pretext that it was facilitating incremental research, but that's far from the whole story. The paper and video still take the time to elaborate on other considerations.

I haven't advertised it much yet, but it is more than one year and a half that I work with the described system, and for my daily research, and it is life-changing. Some of my colleagues have been integrating it smoothly as well and also appreciate it, so I'm a bit more confident about it.

Please don't hesitate to make me know if the problem rings a bell to you, and whether you feel it's a good direction to go or not. I'm really interested in knowing whether it may help some people here.

In short, the principle is quite simple: when dealing with a batch, we can create a big ""mathematical system"" object that holds the data being worked on and does the computations when they are needed, and only once thanks to some cache. Every tensor of interest (variable in the math system) is ""named"" in the sense we can obtain it by doing the call that would compute it, like `math_sys.segmentation_pred('sigmoid')` or `math_sys.segmentation_pred('argmax')`.

Then, we can just pass that object instead of specific tensors to functions that needs them. And we don't have the dilemmas about choosing to propagate logits or sigmoid outputs for instance, nor the miles long signatures and hours of refactoring for just modifying the flow of data.

Finally, because we are using object-oriented programming, and our methods do not use parameters to route data, they are easily overridable, and we can compose them through multiple inheritance. Flow of data becomes pretty much unconstrained.

Some other cool facts:

* Control flow is decoupled between computations of different terms, very cool to avoid unreadable spaghettis
* We have easy access to intermediate results from outside as well (e.g. for debugging/visualization)
* Renders testing much more practical
* Easy to move that whole ""mathematical system"" module from one codebase to another
* We can actually integrate complete pytorch modules inside it, the data-augmentation, the tokenization, ... Typically, I can switch from a CNN to a Transformer by switching a class for another, and it will take care of extra steps required while leaving the rest of the codebase unchanged compared to when there was just a CNN.
* Doesn't cost much in terms of performance, while it opens big opportunities for implementing optimizations and reduces dramatically the risk/need to duplicate computations.
* It will probably not handle a training loop well, because it's not a good fit for mutable state.

More could be done, like turning it into a library, making it compatible with TorchScript/Tensorflow, perhaps creating model zoos based on this, or simply showing more of what is possible with it.

The only thing that has prevented me from creating a library is that I'm not fully happy with the way to define whether a call should be cached or not. I like to have calls cached by default, it is easy to disable (if method is decorated with `@no_cache`, its name starts with `_`, or the call contains kw-only arguments), but I don't find the former to be well defined in case of inheritance. If you have ideas, please make me know.

235,235,egesko,v9fyvp,[D] L2 Regularization on Generator Output (GAN)," Hello,

I  am developing a GAN-like model with the purpose of finding optimum  noise distributions to sample from and introduce to a medium so that any  classification model that takes samples from that medium will fail to  train. Because the zero-sum game GANs play is similar to this game of  generator-classifier fight, my hope is that generator output  distribution will converge towards the optimum noise distribution so  that the classification model will actually fail.

The  question is, is there a correct way to limit the output my GAN  generator actually generates? My initial thought was to add an L2 norm  of generator outputs to the loss function of the generator, kind of like  how we do L2 norm regularization for model weights. But as I trained, I  realized that changing the coefficient of this L2 norm term doesn't  seem to affect the norm of the output generated by the generator. Is  this idea fundamentally flawed? Or is there any other method you can  suggest that might work better?

Abstract:

>Extreme compression, particularly ultra-low bit precision  (binary/ternary) quantization, has been proposed to fit large NLP models  on resource-constraint devices. However, to preserve the accuracy for  such aggressive compression schemes, cutting-edge methods usually  introduce complicated compression pipelines, e.g., multi-stage expensive  knowledge distillation with extensive hyperparameter tuning. Also, they  oftentimes focus less on smaller transformer models that have already  been heavily compressed via knowledge distillation and lack a systematic  study to show the effectiveness of their methods. In this paper, we  perform a very comprehensive systematic study to measure the impact of  many key hyperparameters and training strategies from previous works. As  a result, we find out that previous baselines for ultra-low bit  precision quantization are significantly under-trained. Based on our  study, we propose a simple yet effective compression pipeline for  extreme compression, named XTC. XTC demonstrates that (1) we can **skip  the pre-training knowledge distillation to obtain a 5-layer BERT while  achieving better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods,  e.g., the 6-layer TinyBERT**; (2) **extreme quantization plus layer reduction is able to reduce the model size by 50x**, resulting in new state-of-the-art results on GLUE tasks.

Abstract:

>Training foundation models, such as GPT-3 and PaLM, can be extremely expensive, often involving tens of thousands of GPUs running continuously for months. These models are typically trained in specialized clusters featuring fast, homogeneous interconnects and using carefully designed software systems that support both data parallelism and model/pipeline parallelism. Such dedicated clusters can be costly and difficult to obtain. Can we instead leverage the much greater amount of decentralized, heterogeneous, and lower-bandwidth interconnected compute? Previous works examining the heterogeneous, decentralized setting focus on relatively small models that can be trained in a purely data parallel manner. State-of-the-art schemes for model parallel foundation model training, such as Megatron, only consider the homogeneous data center setting. In this paper, we present the first study of training large foundation models with model parallelism in a decentralized regime over a heterogeneous network. Our key technical contribution is a scheduling algorithm that allocates different computational ""tasklets"" in the training of foundation models to a group of decentralized GPU devices connected by a slow heterogeneous network. We provide a formal cost model and further propose an efficient evolutionary algorithm to find the optimal allocation strategy. We conduct extensive experiments that represent different scenarios for learning over geo-distributed devices simulated using real-world network measurements. **In the most extreme case, across 8 different cities spanning 3 continents, our approach is 4.8X faster than prior state-of-the-art training systems (Megatron)**.

Key findings:

* Machine learning can be used to identify activity on your computer from traces recorded in JavaScript that measure CPU instruction throughput over time
* We found this type of attack exploits signals from system interrupts, which operating systems use to interact with hardware devices
   * When a core processes interrupts, it pauses the execution of an attacker, creating a signal that can be exploited
* Our *loop-counting attack* can correctly identify one of 100 websites being opened 96.6% of the time in Chrome on Linux
* We identified a randomized timer mitigation that reduces our attack’s accuracy to near chance

251,251,irismodel,v7pxj0,[P] Featureform: Open-Source Virtual Feature Store,"Hey everyone!

We’re excited to announce the open-source version of Featureform, an extensible feature store. We’ve found that existing feature stores are either too heavy and replace your existing infrastructure, or don’t handle transformations at all and simply store features. We built a feature store that’s a happy medium between the two, it orchestrates your existing infrastructure to work like a feature store. We wrote more about this in our [blog post](https://www.featureform.com/post/feature-stores-explained-the-three-common-architectures).

# What Is Featureform

[Featureform](https://github.com/featureform/featureform) is a virtual feature store. It enables data scientists to **define**, **manage**, and **serve** their ML model's features. Featureform sits atop your **existing infrastructure** and orchestrates it to work like a traditional feature store. By using Featureform, a data science team can solve the organizational problems:

* **Enhance Collaboration** Featureform ensures that transformations, features, labels, and training sets are defined in a standardized form, so they can easily be shared, re-used, and understood across the team.
* **Organize Experimentation** The days of untitled\_128.ipynb are over. Transformations, features, and training sets can be pushed from notebooks to a centralized feature repository with metadata like name, variant, lineage, and owner.
* **Facilitate Deployment** Once a feature is ready to be deployed, Featureform will orchestrate your data infrastructure to make it ready for production. Using the Featureform API, you won't have to worry about the idiosyncrasies of your heterogeneous infrastructure (beyond their transformation language).
* **Increase Reliability** Featureform enforces that all features, labels, and training sets are immutable. This allows them to safely be re-used among data scientists without worrying about logic changing. Furthermore, Featureform's orchestrator will handle retry logic and attempt to resolve other common distributed system problems automatically.
* **Preserve Compliance** With built-in role-based access control, audit logs, and dynamic serving rules, your compliance logic can be enforced directly by Featureform.

We just launched our first open-source version and would love to hear your thoughts and what you'd like to see! :)

254,254,tomin_tomen,v7r6a7,[Discussion] Should we still fly to conferences?,"Now that COVID appears to be less of a problem in many parts of the world, conferences are gradually returning to a physical format. But something has changed: we now know that online conferences are possible.

Many here have probably had a mixed (very negative?) experience with the virtual conferences. It probably hasn't yet reached its best form to foster collaboration for the worldwide research community. But what would have been almost unimaginable before 2020 has now been tested repeatedly! This brings me to my question:

**Should we still burn insane amounts of plane fuel to fly to the other end of the planet to present a paper/poster a come back home 3 days later?**

Also, as a Ph.D. student, should I refuse to attend a conference because it is too far from where I work, knowing that this might hurt my career, make me miss internship or post-doc opportunities, etc.?

This is, of course, not specific to the Machine Learning community. Still, it seems that the size of the community and the frequency of events worldwide make the problem particularly serious here.

With NeurIPS in New Orleans and AAAI in Atlanta this year, the carbon footprint of a European attending these conferences in person easily passes 2 tCO2. Depending on estimates, this puts you on the order of magnitude of the maximum amount of CO2 every person can emit in a year if we are to limit global warming to +2°C (I'm not precise with the numbers, but it's the orders of magnitude that matter for my point).

I don't have a good answer to this... I also feel that these past few years have not been the best for networking, meeting new researchers, and sharing ideas. However, the current model is in complete dissonance with my convictions and what I believe to be a sustainable lifestyle. Maybe we should preferably attend a conference close to where we work, and force ourselves to use less CO2 emitting ways of getting there.

I welcome the fact that many conferences have recently organized hybrid events, where it is possible to attend virtually OR physically. This makes them accessible to many more people, especially those with fewer resources. But I don’t know if this is just a temporary thing until the pandemic ends, and it is clear that you don’t get the same “experience” as people attending physically (FOMO).

255,255,regalalgorithm,v813pk,[P] GPT3 generation of news stories about AI,"Here's a fun little project I did today on a whim. I happen to have access to the OpenAI API, so I used their playground feature to generate AI headlines with their taglines. I fed it this prompt (sourced from the latest edition of [Last Week in AI](https://lastweekin.ai/); I co-run it, apologies for the plug):

> Last week's top AI news:   
\* Caltech unit creates AI helping drones to withstand violent winds - ""Caltech researchers are developing a drone with rapidly reacting artificial intelligence (AI) capacities that allow it to adapt in flight to extreme wind similar to tornado or hurricane conditions.""   
\* How Deep Squeak, an AI program with a weird name, is detecting whales - ""Artificial Intelligence is booming. And now an AI program is being used to search for whales.""   
\* Ex-golf pro links with Seattle-area AI experts on app that uses 3D motion analysis to improve game - ""Before you take yet another mulligan, consider that the tool to improving your golf game might not be found in your bag of clubs."" 

And it did a pretty good job coming up with random other news stories just by generating text from the prompt: 

> \* Google’s DeepMind creates AI that can beat humans at hide-and-seek - ""A new artificial intelligence program developed by Google’s DeepMind can beat humans at hide-and-seek, according to a new paper.""   
\* Researchers Develop AI System That Can Learn New Skills by Watching YouTube Videos - ""Researchers at the University of Maryland have developed an artificial intelligence system that can learn new skills by watching YouTube videos.""   
\* Carnegie Mellon Researchers Develop AI System That Can Help You Write Better Emails - ""Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed an artificial intelligence system that can help you write better emails.""   
\* New AI System Can Help You Find a Job You’ll Love - ""A new artificial intelligence system developed by researchers at the University of Toronto can help you find a job you’ll love, according to a new study."" 

Though, I was surprised to find it repeats itself super quickly. Would have thought GPT-3 had solved this very basic language model problem... It also seems to repeat actual news stories from the past, such as:

>\* Google DeepMind's AlphaGo Zero AI can teach itself Go and other games in hours - ""DeepMind has created an artificial intelligence system that can not only defeat humans at the game of Go, but also teach itself to play from scratch within hours.""  

I also tried prompting it with just ""Last week's top AI news:"" and got the following:

> 1. Google's DeepMind has created a new algorithm that can predict how proteins will fold.    
>  
>2. Facebook's artificial intelligence research lab has developed a new system that can automatically generate 3D models of objects from 2D images.    
>  
>3. IBM has announced that its Watson AI platform will now be available to developers on the IBM Cloud.    
>  
>4. Microsoft has released a new toolkit that allows developers to build chatbots using the company's Azure cloud platform.  

Lastly, how about ""This week's trending AI papers"" as a prompt. Also not bad:

> 1. ""Deep Learning for Recommender Systems""    
>  
>2. ""A Neural Network Approach to Context-Aware Query Suggestion""    
>  
>3. ""Learning Deep Representations of Fine-Grained Visual Concepts""    
>  
>4. ""Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention""   


A while back I fine-tuned GPT-2 on 100 weeks' worth of AI news (see this [post](https://www.skynettoday.com/digests/ai-news-analysis)), and got some comparatively more amusing stuff:

>Researchers develop a traffic light for self-driving cars  - A pair of new papers from University of Tokyo Institute of  Technology researchers and the World Health Organization claim to have  addressed one of the great challenges of artificial intelligence:  traffic lights. Thanks to machine learning, they can illuminate traffic  for much more effective and safer operation than they could on paper.    
  
>  
>How I used NLP's GPT-3 to write the AI I Created  - When it comes to creating AI, there are 2 main choices I have:-  write a clean code or- just use the output from the original app to  clean code.    
  
>

We thought we'd share some technical details since the underlying code, JoliGAN is Open Source, [https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGAN](https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGAN)

\- The GAN uses a combination of mobile ResNets with attention as a Generator, along with a projected Discriminator \[1\]. Depending on the stone, we sometimes use transformers as well (customized Segformers and ViT mostly). A series of additional neural networks act as semantic constraints to the space of GAN transforms.

\- Real-time is achieved through our full C++ Open Source backend DeepDetect, [https://github.com/jolibrain/deepdetect](https://github.com/jolibrain/deepdetect). We use CUDA along with OpenCV and TensorRT to chain multiple models (ring detection and generator mostly), and we make sure the data remain within CUDA memory at all time. This allows us to reach \~60 FPS on 1080Ti and 20% more on average on an  RTX3090.

JoliGAN is a powerful tool for domain to domain adaptation, with applications to AR, dataset augmentation, and sim2real transformation mostly. Documentation is scarce as the software is essentially used by us for solving our customers' problems.

But hey, it's open :)

I decided to write another blog post finally. This one is about a RL demo we gave at a local conference, involving a tiny quadruped robot that learns to scramble across the floor very quickly. It learns by first mimicking a hand-made policy, and is then trained further in the real-world. Our technology is called Sparse Predictive Hierarchies (SPH), and the library that implements it is called AOgmaNeo. It's a biologically-inspired low-compute sparse online learning system. We are also working on a GPU version of SPH again, so I also included that in the post as well. Enjoy!

258,258,ilia10000,v7sl9p,[D] Looking for paper on infinite stacking of hyperparam optimizers,"A few years ago, I remember seeing a paper on using optimizers to optimize optimizers. The initial premise was that if you have a model and an optimizer, you need to optimize the hyperparams of the optimizer so you can add a sort of hyperoptimizer on top. But this hyperoptimizer also has hyperparams so they then explore what happens when you start stacking more and more of these hyperoptimizers on top of each other. I believe one of the conclusions was that in the limit, model behaviour ends up being independent of the top-level choice of hyperparameters.

259,259,loeffner,v7r5d3,[Discussion] Why is the Competing Conventions Problem in Neuroevolution a problem?,"The Competing Conventions problem or Permutation problem is a problem that occurs in neuroevolution. It arises when there are more than one way to represent a network as a genotype. 

[The competing conventions problem. \[Evolving neural networks through augmenting topologies; Stanley, Miikulainen; 2002\]](https://preview.redd.it/2wth86etpe491.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=73a6bd606e5c8c7bfc181177861f3af19e7dc07a)

When two different genotypes, that represent the same neural network, are recombined during crossover, the emerging offspring is likely to be damaged and missing information. The figure above visualizes the problem for a small neural network. Since the order of the three hidden nodes A, B and C has no influence on the resulting function, the network can be represented by 3! = 6 different permutations. When two of these permutations are recombined during crossover the resulting offspring is missing information. As depicted in the figure the combination of {A, B, C\] and \[C, B, A\] will result in either \[A, B, A\] or \[C, B, C\]. Both of which lack 1/3 of the main components that both their parents had. 

There is also the problem, that the search space is enourmosly enlarged by all the permutations, but my question refers to the first part of the problem. 

&#x200B;

Why is it a problem, that the children of two genotype permutations of the same underlying neural network miss information from their parents. From my understanding, the point of crossover is also exploration, so why are these networks considered damaged, while in other situation it is considered innovation? Offspring is supposed to be different from its parents, otherwise change would only happen through mutations and be completely random.

I have tried to find an explanation, but every paper just seems to see it as a given that the offspring is damaged.",16,14,2022-06-08 20:08:17, discussion  why is the competing conventions problem in neuroevolution a problem ,the competing conventions problem or permutation problem is a problem that occurs in neuroevolution  it arises when there are more than one way to represent a network as a genotype   the competing conventions problem    evolving neural networks through augmenting topologies  stanley  miikulainen      https when two different genotypes  that represent the same neural network  are recombined during crossover  the emerging offspring is likely to be damaged and missing information  the figure above visualizes the problem for a small neural network  since the order of the three hidden nodes a  b and c has no influence on the resulting function  the network can be represented by      different permutations  when two of these permutations are recombined during crossover the resulting offspring is missing information  as depicted in the figure the combination of  a  b  c   and   c  b  a   will result in either   a  b  a   or   c  b  c    both of which lack   of the main components that both their parents had  there is also the problem  that the search space is enourmosly enlarged by all the permutations  but my question refers to the first part of the problem    xb why is it a problem  that the children of two genotype permutations of the same underlying neural network miss information from their parents  from my understanding  the point of crossover is also exploration  so why are these networks considered damaged  while in other situation it is considered innovation  offspring is supposed to be different from its parents  otherwise change would only happen through mutations and be completely random i have tried to find an explanation  but every paper just seems to see it as a given that the offspring is damaged

262,262,emilec___,v7lkxs,"[P][N] Just launched - nebulgym, a new open-source that accelerates AI training (~1.5-2x as of now) in a few lines of code without requiring you to change your training setup","Training always takes too long. If it takes an hour, it would be better if it took 30 minutes, or maybe 15 minutes... or just 1 minute, why not? And if you want to speed up training, the techs available usually require to increase the complexity of the training process, whether it's making trade-off in terms of accuracy or time for the developer to learn a new framework. Often times it's trial and error, playing with parameters, training recipes, or switching framework/model. That's definitely not ideal.

“Fast & easy-to-use” These were keywords that motivated me to work on a new way of doing training, the library `nebulgym`, which now is open-source ([github link](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebulgym)).

**Fast**

Training should be fast, period. Wouldn't it be great if in the near future you could train a GPT3 from scratch on your laptop? Or a large EfficientNet in a fraction of a minute? Nebulgym was built to try to bring developers closer to that future. This open-source optimizes the full training computation stack, from efficient data loading to faster forward and backward passes and earlier convergence. For example, by saving data samples in the cache on the first data read, it speeds up the full data loading process and eliminates what can become the bottleneck for the training process. Nebulgym also leverages techniques such as partial compilation of some calculations and smart sparse gradients to speed up forward and backward gradient propagations. And many more features will be implemented soon. And please let me know / open issues if you have ideas for making nebulgym even faster :)

**Easy-to-use**

""Not another framework, please, there're already 1000"". That's a call for help from many developers, so nebulgym has been developed with this in mind. Nebulgym let you use the training setup you've always used, and works ""on top"". This is made possible with the use of class decorators (like Java's annotations). In short, you can just add these decorators before defining the model classes, and nebulgym will make sure that you use your computing resources to the fullest.

Here's a snippet of training with nebulgym decorators (`@accelerate_dataset` and `@accelerate_model`)

```
import torch
from nebulgym.decorators.torch_decorators import accelerate_model, accelerate_dataset

@accelerate_dataset()
class MyDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
   # Your Dataset definition

@accelerate_model()
class MyModel(torch.nn.Module):
   # Your model definition

# Train your model as you usually do
```

And that's it. Give it a try, and leave a star ⭐, it's a little contribution to show some love for open-source projects :) Also feedback would be super appreciated!

263,263,Scapius,v7fd9r,[D] ML/DL computer build with PCIe 5.0 x8 lanes for RTX 3090,"I'm building my first ML/DL computer around [ASUS ProArt Z690 motherboard](https://www.asus.com/Motherboards-Components/Motherboards/ProArt/ProArt-Z690-CREATOR-WIFI/techspec/),  which has 2 PCIe 5.0 slots (x8 each) and PCIe 3.0 x16 slot. The CPU is  i9-12900K, which comes with 20 PCIe lanes. Since 4 lanes will go to a  single NVMe, I think the motherboard will split the two PCIe 5.0 slots  into 8x lanes each. My current build is with a single RTX 3080 12GB, but  I want to be able to upgrade to 2x3090Ti (or 2x4090) in the future, if  needed. This [article](https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/)  from 2018 seems to imply that DL is unaffected even when PCIe 4.0 4x  are used for up to 2 GPUs. I just want to confirm that this is still  considered sound advice. In other words, 2x3090 GPUs won't be throttled  by PCIe 5.0 x8 lanes, which is equivalent to PCIe 4.0 x16 (see matrix  below). In fact, I'm also wondering if running PCIe 5.0 even at x2 lanes  each won't throttle the GPUs since the equivalent transfer rate is  still PCIe 4.0 x4, as mentioned in that article. Or does the fact that  the motherboard interface is PCIe 5.0 not matter since the GPU can  support only up to PCIe 4.0 speeds?

Any other comments on my build would be welcome: [PCPartpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Kdvxfv).  This will be an everyday computer as well to edit photos/videos and  used for other analyses, hence the more powerful CPU and the NVMe, which  might not matter as much for ML.

What we are currently doing is running Yolo(v5) to extract bounding boxes and then each box goes through an additional neural network that outputs 7 keypoints of the cone (see Images) and just because we know the exact positions of these keypoints relative to each other we can then turn it into a Perspective n-Point problem.

The language observation is a description of the visual observation. The goal is to **ground the language** in the observation.

Ultimately, I need to have one **Observation Encoder** and one **Language Encoder** that take different inputs, but both output similar context vectors.

What would be a technique to make that possible ?

My  first idea was to learn the Observation Encoder on another task, and  then teach the Language Encoder to predict the same context vector as  the Observation Encoder (minimizing cross-entropy). But there may be  some better approach, maybe using techniques I'm not aware of.

I looked briefly into Shared Latent Spaces, but was not sure that it would fit my problem statement. Was I wrong ?

In my problem's case, there are two requirements that would lead to drastically better results if some form of **context** is formed across detected boxes.

**Requirement #1**

It is a multi-class, but single label problem. There are ***N*** classes. But the class can only appear **minimum of 0 and maximum of 1 instance.** Hence, it kinda needs to know the other detections whether they have already predicted something.

**Requirement #2**

There is some form of ordinance between the predictions based on their proximity to each other. For example, Class 4 should only appear near Class 5-6 and Class 2-3. But should not be anywhere near Class 32.

272,272,Singularian2501,v6s1ea,[R] On the Advance of Making Language Models Better Reasoners - 2022 Microsoft,"Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02336](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02336)

Abstract:

>Large language models such as GPT-3 and PaLM have shown remarkable performance in few-shot learning. However, they still struggle with reasoning tasks such as the arithmetic benchmark GSM8K. Recent advances deliberately guide the language model to generate a chain of reasoning steps before producing the final answer, successfully boosting the **GSM8K benchmark from 17.9% to 58.1%** in terms of problem solving rate. In this paper, we propose a new approach, DiVeRSe (Diverse Verifier on Reasoning Step), to further advance their reasoning capability. DiVeRSe first explores different prompts to enhance the diversity in reasoning paths. Second, DiVeRSe introduces a verifier to distinguish good answers from bad answers for a better weighted voting. Finally, DiVeRSe verifies the correctness of each single step rather than all the steps in a whole. **We conduct extensive experiments using the latest language model code-davinci-002 and demonstrate that DiVeRSe can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on six out of eight reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K 74.4% to 83.2%), outperforming the PaLM model with 540B parameters.**

278,278,lvwerra,v66smh,[P] Releasing 🤗 Evaluate - an evaluation library for ML,"Evaluation is one of the most important aspects of ML but today’s evaluation landscape is scattered and undocumented which makes evaluation unnecessarily hard.

For that reason we are excited to release 🤗 Evaluate!

[https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate)

## TL;DR

🤗 Evaluate is a Python library that let's you evaluate models and datasets with a wide range of tools! The core principles are:

* **reproducibility**: run evaluation and save results in a reproducible manner
* **documentation**: each evaluation module comes with a metric cards documenting it's use and limitations
* **ease-of-use**: same interface for a wide range of evaluation tools
* **coverage**: in addition to model metrics we also include comparisons and measurements (more about this below)
* **multimodal**: the library covers a wide range of evaluations from information retrieval to reinforcement learning
* **community driven**: the community can easily add and use new metrics by adding them on the Hugging Face Hub

## Types of evaluation

🤗 Evaluate offers three types of evaluation modules:

* **Metric**: A metric is used to evaluate a model’s performance and usually involves the model’s predictions as well as some ground truth labels. You can find all integrated metrics at evaluate-metric.
* **Comparison**: A comparison is used to compare two models. This can for example be done by comparing their predictions to ground truth labels and computing their agreement. You can find all integrated comparisons at evaluate-comparison.
* **Measurement**: The dataset is as important as the model trained on it. With measurements one can investigate a dataset’s properties. You can find all integrated measurements at evaluate-measurement.

## How to use

All three types of evaluation module can be used in the same way:

    import evaluate
    
    accuracy = evaluate.load(""accuracy"", module_type=""metric"")
    accuracy.compute(references=[0, 1], predictions=[1, 1])
    > {""accuracy"": 0.5}

## Community metrics and metric cards

All evaluation modules live on the Hugging Face Hub as a Space and come with an **interactive** **widget**. See for example accuracy: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/accuracy](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/accuracy). 

In addition to the widget where you can play with the metric you it also displays the **metric card** that documents its use and limitations:

&#x200B;

[Metric widget with metric card on the Hub](https://preview.redd.it/8rsn3j8hv0491.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1013187afabe0ddc4b357d32b9afe57a4fb1e04)

This setup also allows anybody to write their own module, load it to the Hub and share it with their colleagues. With the CLI this only takes a couple of minutes:

    evalute-cli create ""My New Metric""

For more information checkout the guide: [https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/creating\_and\_sharing](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/creating_and_sharing)

You can list all available evaluation modules with the following code:

    evaluate.list_evaluation_modules(
      module_type=""comparison"",
      include_community=False, 
      with_details=True)
    
    >>> [{'name': 'mcnemar', 'type': 'comparison', 'community': False, 'likes': 1},
    ...  {'name': 'exact_match', 'type': 'comparison', 'community': False, 'likes': 0}]

## The Evaluator

We are really excited about the Evaluator. It's another layer of abstraction that let's you pass a model (wrapped in a pipeline), a dataset, and a metric and runs the whole evaluation for you:

    from transformers import pipeline
    from datasets import load_dataset
    import evaluate
    
    eval = evaluate.evaluator(""text-classification"")
    
    results = eval.compute(model_or_pipeline=pipeline(""text-classification"", model=""lvwerra/distilbert-imdb"", device=0)
    					   data=load_dataset(""imdb"", split=""test"").shuffle().select(range(1000)),
    					   metric=evaluate.load(""accuracy""),
                           label_mapping={""NEGATIVE"": 0, ""POSITIVE"": 1},)
    
    print(results)
    >>> {'accuracy': 0.934}

## Saving and sharing results

Finally, storing and sharing results is important for reproducibility but also for the community to know which models perform well. With `evaluate.save()` you can store all your experiment's hyperparameters and results in one line in a JSON file:

    result = accuracy.compute(references=[0,1,0,1], predictions=[1,0,0,1])
    hyperparams = {""model"": ""bert-base-uncased""}
    
    evaluate.save(""./results/"", experiment=""run 42"", **result, **hyperparams)

Furthermore, with `evaluate.push_to_hub()` you can push results directly to the model card on the hub, so you can see them on the right sidebar under ""Evaluation results"" (e.g. see here [https://huggingface.co/philschmid/bart-large-cnn-samsum](https://huggingface.co/philschmid/bart-large-cnn-samsum)).

291,291,ShujiMikami,v600jo,[D] Making sense of questionable transposed convolution decoder.,"The decoder in question comes from [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13332.pdf) and is responsible for converting a set of features obtained from a sequence of frames into an audio sample of 40ms, or 640 samples total.

The problem arises when you begin doing calculations with the parameters presented by the authors. Even assuming that only stride would correspond to an increase in the length of output sequence, the total length would come out to \[batch, 1, 1280\] - twice the size presented in the image. Going further and accounting for kernel sizes nets a vector of size \[batch, 1, 9380\] which is several times larger. 

Looking into it further, I found the authors mention taking inspiration from [WaveGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04208.pdf), where according to the structure presented, the increases in length seems to be in line with the stride used. They also seem to have an [official implementation](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/wavegan/blob/master/wavegan.py) using Tensorflow v1. However, looking at the documentation for TF's implementation, they still count the kernel size towards the resulting output, so the math doesn't seem to add up.

293,293,puppet_pals,v5wo5u,[D] Is this a known issue with Policy Gradient methods?,"Hey all,

I'm working on implementing a few RL algorithms to play Mario bros. I faced a few issues in my REINFORCE implementation and took the time to document them.

One of the issues that comes up is a loss explosion. I use the following code to train my Policy:

```

def train_step(self, data):
""""""train_step runs via `model.fit()`.

It accepts x in the form of observations, and y in the form of a tuple of
the actions and advantages
""""""
observations, (actions, advantages) = data
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
log_probs = self.action_distribution(observations).log_prob(actions)
loss = log_probs * advantages
loss = -tf.math.reduce_sum(loss, axis=-1)
# Make sure to add regularization losses
loss += sum(self.network.losses)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, self.trainable_weights)
self.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, self.trainable_weights))

return {""loss"": loss}

```

As you can see, I take the log_probs using a tensorflow_probability.distributions.Categorical.log_prob(). These values seems to explode to -infinity, causing the loss to be eventually tend towards -infinity when any of the actions consistently have a negative reward and a 0 probability. For further reading, I also documented this issue here: https://github.com/LukeWood/luig-io/tree/master/policy_gradient#loss-explosion

Is this a common issue in the REINFORCE algorithm? From what I can tell, if the model learns to make the probability for a specific action 0, and the reward for that action is negative, the loss will over-prioritize getting this action close to zero - as the gradient at that point in the log function is massive.

This actually seems logical - but does this *always* happen whenever a time penalty exists in an environment and an action exists that doesn't progress the agent?",5,2,2022-06-06 12:15:24, d  is this a known issue with policy gradient methods ,hey all i m working on implementing a few rl algorithms to play mario bros  i faced a few issues in my reinforce implementation and took the time to document them one of the issues that comes up is a loss explosion  i use the following code to train my policy    def train_step self  data  train_step runs via  model fit    it accepts x in the form of observations  and y in the form of a tuple ofthe actions and advantagesobservations   actions  advantages    datawith tf gradienttape   as tape log_probs   self action_distribution observations  log_prob actions loss   log_probs   advantagesloss    tf math reduce_sum loss  axis     make sure to add regularization lossesloss    sum self network losses grads   tape gradient loss  self trainable_weights self optimizer apply_gradients zip grads  self trainable_weights  return  loss  loss    as you can see  i take the log_probs using a tensorflow_probability distributions categorical log_prob    these values seems to explode to  infinity  causing the loss to be eventually tend towards  infinity when any of the actions consistently have a negative reward and a  probability  for further reading  i also documented this issue here  https is this a common issue in the reinforce algorithm  from what i can tell  if the model learns to make the probability for a specific action   and the reward for that action is negative  the loss will over prioritize getting this action close to zero   as the gradient at that point in the log function is massive this actually seems logical   but does this  always  happen whenever a time penalty exists in an environment and an action exists that doesn t progress the agent

Some of the most common machine learning pipelines involve manipulation of tabular data. The current state-of-the-art solution for tabular modeling is the TabTransformer by Amazon from 2020. It incorporates a Transformer block to track relationships between categorical features and makes use of a standard multilayer perceptron to output its final logits. We propose modifications outperforming it on binary classification tasks for three benchmark datasets with more than 1% AUROC gains.

297,297,iFARTONMEN,v5lrbz,Meta Gradient Descent [D],"I  am using a modified gradient descent algorithm that I invented, but it  is very simple and I assume someone has already come up with it. I call  it meta gradient descent because it adjusts the learning rate as it  goes. It is the same as normal gradient descent except for one condition  at the end of the loop: If the algorithm passes a local minimum/maximum it decreases the learning rate, else it increases the learning rate

`if (slope < 0 && prevSlope > 0) || (slope > 0 && prevSlope < 0) { //algorithm passed the function min/max`

`learningRate /= 2`

`} else {`

`learningRate *= 1.05`

`}`

This  helps when the algo has to minimize/maximize functions with massively  different scales where a single constant learning rate would be  detrimental. I also suspect that it is faster at honing the min/max in  general, but I have not done any studies on it. Which is why I am here  asking... Is anyone already familiar with this algorithm? does it have a  name? what are the pros/cons of using it instead of regular gradient  descent?

298,298,Tomsen1410,v5cwvc,"[D] Connecting musical and visual latent spaces in a ""harmonic way""","Hello everyone.

I am currently working on an interdisciplinary project regarding the analysis and visualization of music. My initial idea was to visualize music in a ""cool way"" (psychedelic animations, etc.) using ML. The visuals should somehow represent the structure of the music, e.g. melody, beat, etc. My basic idea is to have an encoder, which brings the music into a latent representation, and a generative decoder that produces images out of the latent code at a given time. Now, there isn't much paired musical-visual training data available, so my thinking was to somehow connect a pre-trained music encoder with a visual decoder. Also, to connect two modalities like this in an unsupervised way seems like a really interesting research area. My problem is that I don't really know how to achieve this. I would somehow need to connect the two latent spaces with each other in a ""natural"" and ""harmonic"" way. I was thinking about stuff like finding the least required ""complexity"" to go from one distribution to another and I have indeed found some papers regarding that. There is also stuff like CycleGAN, which trains this mapping in an end-to-end way.

I just wanted to ask about this here, because honestly it seems like I could go in various directions with this and it is a bit overwhelming. I'd appreciate any kind of help, ideas, recommendations, discussions and any kind of interest. Thanks!

Btw, I have already successfully trained a music encoder in a self-supervised fashion with a relatively large amount of data (\~2000 hours)

&#x200B;

**Update** (capabilities of the music model):

For anyone interested, the model was trained to predict masked regions of a CQT-spectogram. See the following picture to get a grasp about its capabilities:

&#x200B;

[Top: Original spectogram. Middle: Masked spectogram. Bottom: Model prediction](https://preview.redd.it/6xkumxl177491.png?width=3432&format=png&auto=webp&s=29095e720f58c9af5920e256d5526f928302bdf7)

The original spectogram is at the top. It is a 45 second snippet from the song Saku by Bicep (0:30 - 1:15). The triangle shapes are basically the beats and you can see that they are not regularly spaced. There is a similar pattern at the beginning and at the end, but there are these beats in the middle that are very far (\~7 seconds) apart from each other and they are mostly covered by the mask. However as you can see the model successfully predicted them in the output spectogram. Sometimes they are blurry, because the model isn't quite sure whether there is a beat or not, but there are many ways to complete musical patterns in general. Honestly I was quite impressed with this result. It means that the model learned a fundamental understanding of long-term musical structures (as well as short term ones).

Additionally, for some visuals, I have animated the encoder's latent space of this snippet with some bars (PCA'ed down from 768 to 32 dimenstions + smoothed it out a bit):

&#x200B;

[Rudimentary visualization of music latent space](https://reddit.com/link/v5cwvc/video/i626xvk3b7491/player)

The problem is that it is hard to interpret these bars and to connect them to musical concepts (and to visuals). Maybe I shouldn't even do it manually, since there is so much information encoded in them that I don't even know of (see my response to u/DGSPJS in the comments).",7,15,2022-06-05 18:32:20, d  connecting musical and visual latent spaces in a harmonic way,hello everyone i am currently working on an interdisciplinary project regarding the analysis and visualization of music  my initial idea was to visualize music in a cool way  psychedelic animations  etc   using ml  the visuals should somehow represent the structure of the music  e g  melody  beat  etc  my basic idea is to have an encoder  which brings the music into a latent representation  and a generative decoder that produces images out of the latent code at a given time  now  there isn t much paired musical visual training data available  so my thinking was to somehow connect a pre trained music encoder with a visual decoder  also  to connect two modalities like this in an unsupervised way seems like a really interesting research area  my problem is that i don t really know how to achieve this  i would somehow need to connect the two latent spaces with each other in a natural and harmonic way  i was thinking about stuff like finding the least required complexity to go from one distribution to another and i have indeed found some papers regarding that  there is also stuff like cyclegan  which trains this mapping in an end to end way i just wanted to ask about this here  because honestly it seems like i could go in various directions with this and it is a bit overwhelming  i d appreciate any kind of help  ideas  recommendations  discussions and any kind of interest  thanks btw  i have already successfully trained a music encoder in a self supervised fashion with a relatively large amount of data     hours   xb   update    capabilities of the music model  for anyone interested  the model was trained to predict masked regions of a cqt spectogram  see the following picture to get a grasp about its capabilities   xb  top  original spectogram  middle  masked spectogram  bottom  model prediction  https the original spectogram is at the top  it is a  second snippet from the song saku by bicep          the triangle shapes are basically the beats and you can see that they are not regularly spaced  there is a similar pattern at the beginning and at the end  but there are these beats in the middle that are very far     seconds  apart from each other and they are mostly covered by the mask  however as you can see the model successfully predicted them in the output spectogram  sometimes they are blurry  because the model isn t quite sure whether there is a beat or not  but there are many ways to complete musical patterns in general  honestly i was quite impressed with this result  it means that the model learned a fundamental understanding of long term musical structures  as well as short term ones  additionally  for some visuals  i have animated the encoder s latent space of this snippet with some bars  pca ed down from  to  dimenstions   smoothed it out a bit    xb  rudimentary visualization of music latent space  https the problem is that it is hard to interpret these bars and to connect them to musical concepts  and to visuals   maybe i shouldn t even do it manually  since there is so much information encoded in them that i don t even know of  see my response to u dgspjs in the comments  
299,299,jj4646,v5sjge,[D] Machine Learning Models for Longitudinal Data,"Recently, I had the following question about supervised classification models (e.g. random forest) for longitudinal data.

Suppose I have the following data about students passing a fitness test - the students (each student has an ""id"") who enroll in a school take a fitness test each year and record their height and weight (at the start of each school year, before the fitness test). They can either pass (1) or fail (0) the fitness test each year. The school is interested in knowing which students are likely to fail the fitness test, so they can focus more attention on these students. Naturally, some students might have taken the fitness test more times than other students.

I simulated some data (using the R programming language) to show how the historical data might look like:

&#x200B;

    score <- c(""1"",""0"")
    score <- as.numeric(sample(score, 1000, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.3, 0.7)))
    id_sample <- 1:140
    id <- sample(id_sample, replace = TRUE, 1000)
    height <- abs(rnorm(1000, 150,5))
    weight <- abs(rnorm(1000, 75,5))
    
    data = data.frame(id, height, weight, score)
    data <- data[order(data$id),]

I then added two variables to this data - one to show how many times the fitness test was taken, the another to show the (cumulative) average number of times the test was passed:

&#x200B;

    library(dplyr)
    data =  data.frame(data %>% group_by(id) %>% mutate(counter = row_number(id)))
    data$csum <- ave(data$score, data$id, FUN=cumsum)
    data$average <- data$csum/data$counter

Now, suppose some of the students are about to take this test again and we would like to predict what their score will be - some of these students are existing students, but some of these students are new and have never taken the test before (i.e. they have no historical data):

&#x200B;

    id_sample <- 1:140
    id <- sample(id_sample, replace = FALSE, 23)
    height <- abs(rnorm(23, 150,5))
    weight <- abs(rnorm(23, 75,5))
    
    new_data = data.frame(id, height, weight)
    new_data <- new_data[order(new_data$id),]
    
    id_sample <- 141:200
    id <- sample(id_sample, replace = FALSE, 5)
    height <- abs(rnorm(5, 150,5))
    weight <- abs(rnorm(5, 75,5))
    
    #simulating data for students who never took the test before
    n_data = data.frame(id, height, weight)
    n_data <- n_data[order(n_data$id),]
    
    test_data = rbind(new_data, n_data)

Now, to this test data, (where applicable) I added ""longitudinal variables"" that take into account the number of times the students took the test and their most recent average cumulative score:

&#x200B;

    #counter
    max = data.frame(data %>% 
                 group_by(id) %>%
                 filter(counter == max(counter)))
    
    colnames(max)[5] <- ""max_counter""
    
    max$max_counter = max$max_counter + 1
    
    test_with_counter =  merge(x = test_data, y = max, by = ""id"", all.x = TRUE)
    
    test  = test_with_counter[, c(1,2,3,7,9)]
    
     test$max_counter[is.na(test$max_counter)] <- 1
    
     test$average[is.na(test$average)] <- 0
    
    #formatting
    colnames(test)[2] <- ""height""
    colnames(test)[3] <- ""weight""
    colnames(test)[4] <- ""counter""
    data$csum = NULL
    data$score = as.factor(data$score)

At this point, there is nothing stopping me from training a supervised classification model (e.g. random forest) to predict the ""score"" variable for the test data:

&#x200B;

    #skip cross validation for brevity of question
    library(randomForest)
    rf <- randomForest(score~., data=data)
    pred = predict(rf, newdata = test)
    
    print(rf)
    
    Call:
     randomForest(formula = score ~ ., data = data) 
                   Type of random forest: classification
                         Number of trees: 500
    No. of variables tried at each split: 2
    
            OOB estimate of  error rate: 23.4%
    Confusion matrix:
        0   1 class.error
    0 636  79   0.1104895

**My Question:** Does the approach that I have proposed for supervised classification of longitudinal data sound reasonable (e.g. better than ""nothing"") - or are there any major statistical flaws on this approach (e.g. structural multicollinearity, variance inflation, etc.) ? Or is it better to use some supervised classification model/software implementation that has been specifically designed for longitudinal data (e.g. [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LongituRF/LongituRF.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LongituRF/LongituRF.pdf))? Thanks!

**Note:**

&#x200B;

\- This is a rough sketch of the situation I am dealing with - I am also planning to include variables such as ""number of days that elapsed since last fitness test"".

&#x200B;

\- The sample data in this reddit question is randomly simulated and obviously wont show any longitudinal trends.

1. Does it make any sense to provide a learning model with additional channels that can be derived from the original image itself? For example let's say I provide the 960x720x3 image, but add an additional channel that's just the negative, or grayscale of the same image? I presume not, because the grayscale image would just be a linear combination of the 3 color channels, right? Or perhaps there's some significant computational advantage to that? 

2. Does it make sense to cut the image up into a bunch of (50%) overlapping squares and then feed these smaller images to my CNN? It's unlikely that the object will ever be larger than one of these squares, so that could make sense, right? It should be computationally much more efficient, because the CNN compute would be much lower, even despite the overhead of processing more (but smaller) squares.

Abstract:

"" Neural logical reasoning (NLR) is a fundamental task in knowledge discovery and artificial intelligence. NLR aims at answering multi-hop queries with logical operations on structured knowledge bases based on distributed representations of queries and answers. While previous neural logical reasoners can give specific entity-level answers, i.e., perform **inductive reasoning** from the perspective of logic theory, they are not able to provide descriptive concept-level answers, i.e., perform **abductive reasoning**, where each concept is a summary of a set of entities. In particular, the abductive reasoning task attempts to infer the explanations of each query with descriptive concepts, which make answers comprehensible to users and is of great usefulness in the field of applied ontology. In this work, we formulate the problem of the **joint abductive and inductive neural logical reasoning (AI-NLR)**, solving which needs to address challenges in **incorporating, representing, and operating on concepts**. We propose an original solution named ABIN for AI-NLR. Firstly, we incorporate description logic-based ontological axioms to provide the source of concepts. Then, we represent concepts and queries as fuzzy sets, i.e., sets whose elements have degrees of membership, to bridge concepts and queries with entities. Moreover, we design operators involving concepts on top of the fuzzy set representation of concepts and queries for optimization and inference. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ABIN for AI-NLR.""

302,302,omniverse71,v5gr3f,[R] Objective measurement of political bias using machine learning,"Sociologists frequently attempt to compare the degree of bias among left and right-wing voters. In a typical study setting, participants are asked a number of factual knowledge questions and the responses are compared to the correct answers. Then, the side whose partisans make the largest errors is declared to be the most biased.

Unfortunately, this approach is extremely vulnerable to biases of the researchers themselves. Consciously or subconsciously, the researchers are likely to select questions whose answers favor their own side. For example, on the topic of Obama’s economic policies, a left-leaning researcher might prefer questions, such as

*“Did the unemployment rate decline under the Obama administration?”* (correct answer: “*yes*”).

In contrast, a right-leaning researcher working on the same topic, is more likely to ask

*“Did the adult employment rate rise under the Obama administration?”* (correct answer: “*no*”).

In both cases the study participants whose biases align with the biases of the researchers would be much more likely to answer the questions correctly.

To address this problem, we built an SVD-based algorithm that measures partisan bias in question selection and corrects testing results based on the measurements. The algorithm’s accuracy improves with increasing data size, so if you have a few minutes to spare, please help our project by taking any of these tests:

310,310,radi-cho,v4kxm0,[D] Parameter optimisation as a language problem?,"Hello! I am thinking of an idea for research on the topic of parameter optimisation viewed as a language problem. Here is what I mean by that - There are already multiple big pre-trained language models such as CodeBERT which can generate good contextual embeddings for source code. So if they're used as a baseline and built upon, we can create a supervised learning pipeline that predicts code parameters which satisfy desired outcomes. For example if we have the function `def f(x): return 2 + 2 * x - x*x` we can ask the model to `maximise` it and to find that the desired x is 1. At the beginning we expect to be able to solve such simple optimisation problems, but with time we may derive methods which are able to solve for more parameters and complicated functions and probably even have such a model to optimise parameters for other ML models in the future. If achieved this approach may replace or work together with traditional hyper-parameter tuning solutions like Bayesian optimisation (which are computationally expensive since they require testing the function itself with multiple parameters).

One approach will be to take the problem purely as a language task and replace the desired parameter(s) with a masked token and then train a model (fine-tune pre-trained BERT-like model) to predict such tokens given desired outcomes.

Another approach will be to take advantage of the pre-trained NL-PL models to generate embeddings for the source code, but then use these representations in a separate regression model. In this case it might be a good idea to built some meta learning environment to better generalise to different functions and then take few-shot approach by first providing a few examples of input-result pairs and then asking for predicted parameters given a desired outcome.

What do you think about the idea as a whole and the proposed approaches? Do you think they're feasible and if not - why?

5. **Matrix multiplication with Bfloat16 on ALL hardware**/?ASD@! Not the cheap 2x extra memory copying trick - true 0 extra RAM usage on the fly CPU conversion.
6. New Paratrooper Optimizer which trains neural nets 50% faster using the latest fast algos.
7. **Sparse blocked matrix multiplication on ALL hardware (NNs)** !!
8. Super fast Neural Net training with batched multiprocessing (ie when NN is doing backprop on batch 1, we load batch 2 already etc).
9. Super fast softmax making attention `softmax(Q @ K.T / sqrt(d))V` super fast and all operations use the fastest possible matrix multiplciation config (tall skinny, square matrices)
10. AND MORE!!!

Old algos made faster:

1. 70% less time to fit Least Squares / Linear Regression than sklearn + 50% less memory usage
2. 50% less time to fit Non Negative Matrix Factorization than sklearn due to new parallelized algo
3. 40% faster full Euclidean / Cosine distance algorithms
4. 50% less time LSMR iterative least squares
5. 50% faster Sparse Matrix operations - parallelized
6. RandomizedSVD is now 20 - 30% faster

I have multiple deep learning/machine learning / naive based tasks that I want to deploy online through an API. I have been trying to figure out the best way to do it for some time, but I am overwhelmed by the number of different frameworks and packages available on AWS and GCP.

Multiple tools on both platforms seem to have overlapping responsibilities with unclear limitations, making it hard to choose.

I want to obtain a scalable pipeline that saves as much money as possible (using, for example, spot pricing) and is easily expandable with new components.

My idea was to use celery and create a task for each different data processing method I have. The APIs would simply add an entry into the celery's queue, and the workers would take care of the rest.

Scaling up or down the pipeline would be just a matter of adding or removing celery workers, then.

&#x200B;

Do you know of any resources worth readying to build an architecture like this?

1. MLEM can package an ML model into a Docker image or a Python package, and deploy it to, for example, Heroku.

2. MLEM saves all model metadata to a human-readable text file: Python environment, model methods, model input & output data schema and more.

3. MLEM helps you turn your Git repository into a Model Registry with features like ML model lifecycle management.

Our philosophy is that MLOps tools should be built using the Unix approach - each tool solves a single problem, but solves it very well. MLEM was designed to work hands on hands with Git - it saves all model metadata to a human-readable text files and Git becomes a source of truth for ML models. Model weights file can be stored in the cloud storage using a Data Version Control tool or such - independently of MLEM.

This is a follow-up on a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/uosqgm/p_i_was_tired_of_screenshotting_plots_in_jupyter/) from two weeks ago.

To communicate results, data scientists often resort to screenshotting plots and sharing them over Slack or email. Visualizations are great to summarize findings, but they're often ambiguous and lack context. 

To make communication easier, we've created a new `%%publish` magic (previously named `%%share`) that decouples a Jupyter cell from its notebook and transforms it into an standalone web-hosted Python script, easily shareable and runnable.

While we've supported the ability to share cells publicly, many of you expressed that the results you want to share need to remain private.

**Today, we're excited to announce that the Jupyter cells you publish are now private by default.**

Running

    %%publish
    # Your Python code goes here..

will bring you to the web app, where you can select the list of person to share with.

Private sharing requires you to create an account. If you don't want to, you can still share publicly by using the following:

    %%publish --public
    # Your Python code goes here..

334,334,diningeachox,v3ckz3,[P] Live Video Inference,"Hi everyone,

I have a dataset of annotated videos for binary classification. I.e. each video just has one label: positive or negative. Right now I have a trained model in place for taking a complete video as input and outputting a classification. So far so good.

Now the clients I'm working with want a feature for inference on live videos as well. I'm sort of at a loss  on how to achieve this with the dataset I'm given. Since live video inference would entail inferring frame by frame and I don't actually have any labelled frames (only the entire video is given a label).

So what I'm thinking is that I have to somehow figure out which frames in the positively-labelled videos are the ones to actually make the video positive. Is there a theory for this kind of problem? 

Here's what I've considered so far:

1) Use an anomaly detection algorithm to figure out which frames are anomalous to the others, and use those frames as positive frames for training the frame-by-frame model.

2) This is a long shot but you take out one frame at a time for the positive videos and infer on the new video with that frame missing. Then see which frame(s) makes the confidence score for positivity drop the most after being taken out.  

I'm sure there are better ideas out there.

The key insight is the **multi-agent** **advantage decomposition theorem** (a lemma we happen to discover during the development of **HATRPO/HAPPO \[ICLR 22\]** [**https://openreview.net/forum?id=EcGGFkNTxdJ**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=EcGGFkNTxdJ)), which surprisingly and effectively turns multi-agent learning problems into sequential decision-making problems, thus MARL is implementable and solvable by the decoder architecture in the Transformer, with no hacks needed at all!

MAT is different from Decision Transformer or GATO which are purely trained on pre-collected offline demonstration data (more like a supervised learning task), but rather MAT is trained online by trails and errors (also, it is an on-policy RL method). Experiments on StarCraft II, Bimanual Dexterous Hands, MA-MuJoCo, and Google Football show MAT's superior performance (stronger than **MAPPO** and **HAPPO**).

Abstract: 

"" Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: **15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup** on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, **3× speedup on GPT-2** (seq. length 1K), and 2.4× speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the **Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy**).

351,351,qazmkopp,v2dlgq,[P]MMML | Deploy HuggingFace training model rapidly based on MetaSpore," A few days ago, HuggingFace announced a $100 million Series C funding round, which was big news in open source machine learning and could be a sign of where the industry is headed. Two days before the HuggingFace funding announcement, open-source machine learning platform [**MetaSpore**](https://github.com/meta-soul/MetaSpore) released a demo based on the HuggingFace Rapid deployment pre-training model.

As deep learning technology makes innovative breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, speech understanding, and other fields, more and more unstructured data are perceived, understood, and processed by machines. These advances are mainly due to the powerful learning ability of deep learning. Through pre-training of deep models on massive data, the models can capture the internal data patterns, thus helping many downstream tasks. With the industry and academia investing more and more energy in the research of pre-training technology, the distribution warehouses of pre-training models such as HuggingFace and Timm have emerged one after another. The open-source community release pre-training significant model dividends at an unprecedented speed.

In recent years, the data form of machine modeling and understanding has gradually evolved from single-mode to multi-mode, and the semantic gap between different modes is being eliminated, making it possible to retrieve data across modes. Take CLIP, OpenAI’s open-source work, as an example, to pre-train the twin towers of images and texts on a dataset of 400 million pictures and texts and connect the semantics between pictures and texts. Many researchers in the academic world have been solving multimodal problems such as image generation and retrieval based on this technology. Although the frontier technology through the semantic gap between modal data, there is still a heavy and complicated model tuning, offline data processing, high performance online reasoning architecture design, heterogeneous computing, and online algorithm be born multiple processes and challenges, hindering the frontier multimodal retrieval technologies fall to the ground and pratt &whitney.

[**DMetaSoul**](https://github.com/meta-soul) aims at the above technical pain points, abstracting and uniting many links such as model training optimization, online reasoning, and algorithm experiment, forming a set of solutions that can quickly apply offline pre-training model to online. This paper will introduce how to use the HuggingFace community pre-training model to conduct online reasoning and algorithm experiments based on [**MetaSpore**](https://github.com/meta-soul/MetaSpore) technology ecology so that the benefits of the pre-training model can be fully released to the specific business or industry and small and medium-sized enterprises. And we will give the text search text and text search graph two multimodal retrieval demonstration examples for your reference.

**1. Multimodal semantic retrieval**

The sample architecture of multimodal retrieval is as follows:  
Our multimodal retrieval system supports both text search and text search application scenarios, including offline processing, model reasoning, online services, and other core modules:

https://preview.redd.it/w4v4c7vcez291.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=0687efb1fddb26e8e30cb844d398ec712b947f31

 

1. Offline processing, including offline data processing processes for different application scenarios of text search and text search, including model tuning, model export, data index database construction, data push, etc.
2. Model inference. After the offline model training, we deployed our NLP and CV large models based on the MetaSpore Serving framework. MetaSpore Serving helps us conveniently perform online inference, elastic scheduling, load balancing, and resource scheduling in heterogeneous environments.
3. Online services. Based on MetaSpore’s online algorithm application framework, MetaSpore has a complete set of reusable online search services, including Front-end retrieval UI, multimodal data preprocessing, vector recall and sorting algorithm, AB experimental framework, etc. MetaSpore also supports text search by text and image scene search by text and can be migrated to other application scenarios at a low cost.

The HuggingFace open source community has provided several excellent baseline models for similar multimodal retrieval problems, which are often the starting point for actual optimization in the industry. MetaSpore also uses the pre-training model of the HuggingFace community in its online services of searching words by words and images by words. Searching words by words is based on the semantic similarity model of the question and answer field optimized by MetaSpore, and searching images by words is based on the community pre-training model.

These community open source pre-training models are exported to the general ONNX format and loaded into MetaSpore Serving for online reasoning. The following sections will provide a detailed description of the model export and online retrieval algorithm services. The reasoning part of the model is standardized SAAS services with low coupling with the business. Interested readers can refer to my previous post: The design concept of MetaSpore, a new generation of the one-stop machine learning platform.

**1.1 Offline Processing**  
Offline processing mainly involves the export and loading of online models and index building and pushing of the document library. You can follow the step-by-step instructions below to complete the offline processing of text search and image search and see how the offline pre-training model achieves reasoning at MetaSpore.

***1.1.1 Search text by text***  
Traditional text retrieval systems are based on literal matching algorithms such as BM25. Due to users’ diverse query words, a semantic gap between query words and documents is often encountered. For example, users misspell “iPhone” as “Phone,” and search terms are incredibly long, such as “1 \~ 3 months old baby autumn small size bag pants”. Traditional text retrieval systems will use spelling correction, synonym expansion, search terms rewriting, and other means to alleviate the semantic gap but fundamentally fail to solve this problem. Only when the retrieval system fully understands users’ query terms and documents can it meet users’ retrieval demands at the semantic level. With the continuous progress of pre-training and representational learning technology, some commercial search engines continue to integrate semantic vector retrieval methods based on symbolic learning into the retrieval ecology.

***Semantic retrieval model***  
This paper introduces a set of semantic vector retrieval applications. MetaSpore built a set of semantic retrieval systems based on encyclopedia question and answer data. MetaSpore adopted the Sentence-Bert model as the semantic vector representation model, which fine-tunes the twin tower BERT in supervised or unsupervised ways to make the model more suitable for retrieval tasks. The model structure is as follows:

The query-Doc symmetric two-tower model is used in text search and question and answer retrieval. The vector representation of online Query and offline DOC share the same vector representation model, so it is necessary to ensure the consistency of the offline DOC library building model and online Query inference model. The case uses MetaSpore’s text representation model Sbert-Chinese-QMC-domain-V1, optimized in the open-source semantically similar data set. This model will express the question and answer data as a vector in offline database construction. The user query will be expressed as a vector by this model in online retrieval, ensuring that query-doc in the same semantic space, users’ semantic retrieval demands can be guaranteed by vector similarity metric calculation.

Since the text presentation model does vector encoding for Query online, we need to export the model for use by the online service. Go to the q&A data library code directory and export the model concerning the documentation. In the script, Pytorch Tracing is used to export the model. The models are exported to the “./export “directory. The exported models are mainly ONNX models used for wired reasoning, Tokenizer, and related configuration files. The exported models are loaded into MetaSpore Serving by the online Serving system described below for model reasoning. Since the exported model will be copied to the cloud storage, you need to configure related variables in env.sh.

**\_Build library based on text search \_**  
The retrieval database is built on the million-level encyclopedia question and answer data set. According to the description document, you need to download the data and complete the database construction. The question and answer data will be coded as a vector by the offline model, and then the database construction data will be pushed to the service component. The whole process of database construction is described as follows:

1. Preprocessing, converting the original data into a more general JSonline format for database construction;
2. Build index, use the same model as online “sbert-Chinese-qmc-domain-v1” to index documents (one document object per line);
3. Push inverted (vector) and forward (document field) data to each component server.

The following is an example of the database data format. After offline database construction is completed, various data are pushed to corresponding service components, such as Milvus storing vector representation of documents and MongoDB storing summary information of documents. Online retrieval algorithm services will use these service components to obtain relevant data.

***1.1.2 Search by text***  
Text and images are easy for humans to relate semantically but difficult for machines. First of all, from the perspective of data form, the text is the discrete ID type of one-dimensional data based on words and words. At the same time, images are continuous two-dimensional or three-dimensional data. Secondly, the text is a subjective creation of human beings, and its expressive ability is vibrant, including various turning points, metaphors, and other expressions, while images are machine representations of the objective world. In short, bridging the semantic gap between text and image data is much more complex than searching text by text. The traditional text search image retrieval technology generally relies on the external text description data of the image or the nearest neighbor retrieval technology and carries out the retrieval through the image associated text, which in essence degrades the problem to text search. However, it will also face many issues, such as obtaining the associated text of pictures and whether the accuracy of text search by text is high enough. The depth model has gradually evolved from single-mode to multi-mode in recent years. Taking the open-source project of OpenAI, CLIP, as an example, train the model through the massive image and text data of the Internet and map the text and image data into the same semantic space, making it possible to implement the text and image search technology based on semantic vector.

***CLIP graphic model***  
The text search pictures introduced in this paper are implemented based on semantic vector retrieval, and the CLIP pre-training model is used as the two-tower retrieval architecture. Because the CLIP model has trained the semantic alignment of the twin towers’ text and image side models on the massive graphic and text data, it is particularly suitable for the text search graph scene.

Due to the different image and text data forms, the Query-Doc asymmetric twin towers model is used for text search image retrieval. The image-side model of the twin towers is used for offline database construction, and the text-side model is used for the online return. In the final online retrieval, the database data of the image side model will be searched after the text side model encodes Query, and the CLIP pre-training model guarantees the semantic correlation between images and texts. The model can draw the graphic pairs closer in vector space by pre-training on a large amount of visual data.  
Here we need to export the text-side model for online MetaSpore Serving inference. Since the retrieval scene is based on Chinese, the CLIP model supporting Chinese understanding is selected. The exported content includes the ONNX model used for online reasoning and Tokenizer, similar to the text search. MetaSpore Serving can load model reasoning through the exported content.

***Build library on Image search***  
You need to download the Unsplash Lite library data and complete the construction according to the instructions. The whole process of database construction is described as follows:

1. Preprocessing, specify the image directory, and then generate a more general JSOnline file for library construction;
2. Build index, use OpenAI/Clip-Vit-BASE-Patch32 pre-training model to index the gallery, and output one document object for each line of index data;
3. Push inverted (vector) and forward (document field) data to each component server. Like text search, after offline database construction, relevant data will be pushed to service components, called by online retrieval algorithm services to obtain relevant data.

**1.2 Online Services**  
The overall online service architecture diagram is as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/jfsl8hdfez291.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a858e2304a0c93e78ba5429612ca08cbee69b35a

Multi-mode search online service system supports application scenarios such as text search and text search. The whole online service consists of the following parts:

1. Query preprocessing service: encapsulate preprocessing logic (including text/image, etc.) of pre-training model, and provide services through gRPC interface;
2. Retrieval algorithm service: the whole algorithm processing link includes AB experiment tangent flow configuration, MetaSpore Serving call, vector recall, sorting, document summary, etc.;
3. User entry service: provides a Web UI interface for users to debug and track down problems in the retrieval service.

From a user request perspective, these services form invocation dependencies from back to front, so to build up a multimodal sample, you need to run each service from front to back first. Before doing this, remember to export the offline model, put it online and build the library first. This article will introduce the various parts of the online service system and make the whole service system step by step according to the following guidance. See the ReadME at the end of this article for more details.

***1.2.1 Query preprocessing service***  
Deep learning models tend to be based on tensors, but NLP/CV models often have a preprocessing part that translates raw text and images into tensors that deep learning models can accept. For example, NLP class models often have a pre-tokenizer to transform text data of string type into discrete tensor data. CV class models also have similar processing logic to complete the cropping, scaling, transformation, and other processing of input images through preprocessing. On the one hand, considering that this part of preprocessing logic is decoupled from tensor reasoning of the depth model, on the other hand, the reason of the depth model has an independent technical system based on ONNX, so MetaSpore disassembled this part of preprocessing logic.

NLP pretreatment Tokenizer has been integrated into the Query pretreatment service. MetaSpore dismantlement with a relatively general convention. Users only need to provide preprocessing logic files to realize the loading and prediction interface and export the necessary data and configuration files loaded into the preprocessing service. Subsequent CV preprocessing logic will also be integrated in this manner.

The preprocessing service currently provides the gRPC interface invocation externally and is dependent on the Query preprocessing (QP) module in the retrieval algorithm service. After the user request reaches the retrieval algorithm service, it will be forwarded to the service to complete the data preprocessing and continue the subsequent processing. The ReadMe provides details on how the preprocessing service is started, how the preprocessing model exported offline to cloud storage enters the service, and how to debug the service.

To further improve the efficiency and stability of model reasoning, MetaSpore Serving implements a Python preprocessing submodule. So MetaSpore can provide gRPC services through user-specified preprocessor.py, complete Tokenizer or CV-related preprocessing in NLP, and translate requests into a Tensor that deep models can handle. Finally, the model inference is carried out by MetaSpore, Serving subsequent sub-modules.

***1.2.2 Retrieval algorithm services***  
Retrieval algorithm service is the core of the whole online service system, which is responsible for the triage of experiments, the assembly of algorithm chains such as preprocessing, recall, sorting, and the invocation of dependent component services. The whole retrieval algorithm service is developed based on the Java Spring framework and supports multi-mode retrieval scenarios of text search and text search graph. Due to good internal abstraction and modular design, it has high flexibility and can be migrated to similar application scenarios at a low cost.  
Here’s a quick guide to configuring the environment to set up the retrieval algorithm service. See ReadME for more details:

1. Install dependent components. Use Maven to install the online-Serving component
2. Search for service configurations. Copy the template configuration file and replace the MongoDB, Milvus, and other configurations based on the development/production environment.
3. Install and configure Consul. Consul allows you to synchronize the search service configuration in real-time, including cutting the flow of experiments, recall parameters, and sorting parameters. The project’s configuration file shows the current configuration parameters of text search and text search. The parameter modelName in the stage of pretreatment and recall is the corresponding model exported in offline processing.
4. Start the service. Once the above configuration is complete, the retrieval service can be started from the entry script. Once the service is started, you can test it! For example, for a user with userId=10 who wants to query “How to renew ID card,” access the text search service.

***1.2.3 User Entry Service***  
Considering that the retrieval algorithm service is in the form of the API interface, it is difficult to locate and trace the problem, especially for the text search image scene can intuitively display the retrieval results to facilitate the iterative optimization of the retrieval algorithm. This paper provides a lightweight Web UI interface for text search and image search, a search input box, and results in a display page for users. Developed by Flask, the service can be easily integrated with other retrieval applications. The service calls the retrieval algorithm service and displays the returned results on the page.

It’s also easy to install and start the service. Once you’re done, go to [http://127.0.0.1:8090](http://127.0.0.1:8090/) to see if the search UI service is working correctly. See the ReadME at the end of this article for details.

**2. Multimodal system demonstration**  
The multimodal retrieval service can be started when offline processing and online service environment configuration have been completed following the above instructions. Examples of textual searches are shown below.  
Enter the entry of the text search map application, enter “cat” first, and you can see that the first three digits of the returned result are cats:

 If you add a color constraint to “cat” to retrieve “black cat,” you can see that it does return a black cat: 

https://preview.redd.it/rzc0qjyjez291.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5bcc503ef0fb3360c7740e60e295cf372dcad47

 Further, strengthen the constraint on the search term, change it to “black cat on the bed,” and return results containing pictures of a black cat climbing on the bed: 

&#x200B;

The cat can still be found through the text search system after the color and scene modification in the above example.

**Conclusion**  
The cutting-edge pre-training technology can bridge the semantic gap between different modes, and the HuggingFace community can greatly reduce the cost for developers to use the pre-training model. Combined with the technological ecology of MetaSpore online reasoning and online microservices provided by DMetaSpore, the pre-training model is no longer mere offline dabbling. Instead, it can truly achieve end-to-end implementation from cutting-edge technology to industrial scenarios, fully releasing the dividends of the pre-training large model. In the future, [DMetaSoul](https://github.com/meta-soul) will continue to improve and optimize the MetaSpore technology ecosystem:

1. More automated and wider access to HuggingFace community ecology. MetaSpore will soon release a common model rollout mechanism to make HuggingFace ecologically accessible and will later integrate preprocessing services into online services.
2. Multi-mode retrieval offline algorithm optimization. For multimodal retrieval scenarios, MetaSpore will continuously iteratively optimize offline algorithm components, including text recall/sort model, graphic recall/sort model, etc., to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the retrieval algorithm.

Clarifies quite a lot of findings of GATO in a neat way. Scale helps (as always ;)), transfer learning capabilities are evident:-

>... We hence devise our own evaluation setup by pretraining DT, CQL, CPC, BERT, and ACL on the  
full datasets of the 41 training games with 50M steps each, and fine-tuning one model per held-out game using 1% (500k steps) from each game...

It also appears adding more data, whether expert or non-expert still allows DT to gain the edge over Behavioral cloning+expert data.

It also achieves super human level performance across 41 games, so catastrophic forgetting seems less relevant and *perhaps* alleviated by scaling alone...

I work in industry so I'm not a researcher and I was looking to attend some conferences to expand my network. Conferences like ICML or NIPS seem way too theoretical and the people involved are on a completely different level compared to what I do day-to-day.

I build xgboost models mostly and occasionally use some standard deep learning methods from blogposts for my work.
